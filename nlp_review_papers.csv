Transforming functional models to critical chain models via expert knowledge and automatic parsing rules for design analogy identification,"Critical chains composed of critical flows and functions have been demonstrated as an effective qualitative analogy retrieval approach based on performance metrics. In prior work, engineers used expert knowledge to transform functional models into critical chain models, which are abstractions of the functional model. Automating this transformation process is highly desirable so as to provide for a robust transformation method. Within this paper, two paradigms for functional modeling abstraction are compared. A series of pruning rules provide an automated transformation approach, and this is compared to the results generated previously through an expert knowledge approach. These two approaches are evaluated against a set of published functional models. The similarity of the resulting transformation of the functional models into critical chain models is evaluated using a functional chain similarity metric, developed in previous work. Once critical chain models are identified, additional model evaluation criteria are used to evaluate the utility of the critical chain models for design analogy identification. Since the functional vocabulary acts as a common language among designers and engineers to abstract and represent critical design artifact information, analogous matching can be made about the functional vocabulary. Thus, the transformation of functional models into critical chain models enables engineers to use functional abstraction as a mechanism to identify design analogies. The critical flow rule is the most effective first step when automatically transforming a functional model to a critical chain model. Further research into more complex critical chain model architectures and the interactions between criteria is merited.",2017,"Agyemang, Malena; Linsey, Julie; Turner, Cameron J.",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Functional Modeling; Design by Analogy; Analogy Matching; Automated Abstraction; Functional Criteria Metrics
Creative exploration using topic-based bisociative networks,"Bisociative knowledge discovery is an approach that combines elements from two or more 'incompatible' domains to generate creative solutions and insight. Inspired by Koestler's notion of bisociation, in this paper we propose a computational framework for the discovery of new connections between domains to promote creative discovery and inspiration in design. Specifically, we propose using topic models on a large collection of unstructured text ideas from multiple domains to discover creative sources of inspiration. We use these topics to generate a Bisociative Information Network - a graph that captures conceptual similarity between ideas - that helps designers find creative links within that network. Using a dataset of thousands of ideas from OpenIDEO, an online collaborative community our results show usefulness of representing conceptual bridges through collections of words (topics) in finding cross-domain inspiration. We show that the discovered links between domains, whether presented on their own or via ideas they inspired, are perceived to be more novel and can also be used as creative stimuli for new idea generation.",2018,"Ahmed, F; Fuge, M",DESIGN SCIENCE,bisociative networks; conceptual design; computational creativity; design creativity; idea generation; DESIGN
Ontology-based similarity for product information retrieval,"Product development of today is becoming increasingly knowledge intensive. Specifically, design teams face considerable challenges in making effective use of increasing amounts of information. In order to support product information retrieval and reuse, one approach is to use case-based reasoning (CBR) in which problems are solved “by using or adapting solutions to old problems.” In CBR, a case includes both a representation of the problem and a solution to that problem. Case-based reasoning uses similarity measures to identify cases which are more relevant to the problem to be solved. However, most non-numeric similarity measures are based on syntactic grounds, which often fail to produce good matches when confronted with the meaning associated to the words they compare. To overcome this limitation, ontologies can be used to produce similarity measures that are based on semantics. This paper presents an ontology-based approach that can determine the similarity between two classes using feature-based similarity measures that replace features with attributes. The proposed approach is evaluated against other existing similarities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study on product-service-system design problems.

A clustering-based approach for the evaluation of candidate emerging technologies,"The aim of this study is to propose a clustering-based approach based on patent information for the evaluation of candidate emerging technologies. The proposed approach uses patent analysis and clustering approaches in data mining. Patent analysis is a widely used method for the evaluation of candidate emerging technologies in the literature. The clustering algorithms used in this study are self-organizing maps, expected maximization and density-based clustering. A real-life application on dental implant technology is presented to show how the proposed approach works in practice. The contributions of this study are twofold. This study contributes to the literature by taking into account claims, forward citations, backward citations, technology cycle times, and technology scores for the evaluation of candidate emerging technologies. Second, the evaluation of dental implant technology with respect to claims, forward citations, backward citations, technology cycle times, and technology scores has not been conducted so far. The results obtained from the application shows that dental implant technology is an candidate emerging technology and the proposed approach can be easily conducted in real life case studies.",2020,"Altuntas, Serkan; Erdogan, Zulfiye; Dereli, Turkay",SCIENTOMETRICS,Candidate emerging technologies; Clustering algorithms; Dental implant technology; Patent analysis; Technology indexes
AUTOMATIC-GENERATION OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION,"In this paper, technical documentation of large systems of equipment is discussed. A general survey of the trends in documentation shows that electronic media are becoming the means of documentation. New functionalities are included in the documentation and the traditional borders between different types of documentation in design, operation, and maintenance are blurred. As examples of the potential new documentation systems, hypertext systems and the system for generating documents and manuals, DOCSY, are discussed. In particular the focus is on the modeling methodology and the generation of natural language. The paper is closed by the introduction to future research activities on HYPERDOCSY systems, which are based on a number of results from the previous project.",1991,"ANDERSEN, A; MUNCH, KH",EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,;
Natural language processing methods for knowledge management-Applying document clustering for fast search and grouping of engineering documents,"Product development companies collect data in form of Engineering Change Requests for logged design issues, tests, and product iterations. These documents are rich in unstructured data (e.g. free text). Previous research affirms that product developers find that current IT systems lack capabilities to accurately retrieve relevant documents with unstructured data. In this research, we demonstrate a method using Natural Language Processing and document clustering algorithms to find structurally or contextually related documents from databases containing Engineering Change Request documents. The aim is to radically decrease the time needed to effectively search for related engineering documents, organize search results, and create labeled clusters from these documents by utilizing Natural Language Processing algorithms. A domain knowledge expert at the case company evaluated the results and confirmed that the algorithms we applied managed to find relevant document clusters given the queries tested.",2021,"Arnarsson, Ivar Orn; Frost, Otto; Gustavsson, Emil; Jirstrand, Mats; Malmqvist, Johan",CONCURRENT ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,knowledge management; natural language processing; document clustering; engineering change request; semantic data processing
Natural language approach for bio-informed architectural education: a biomimetic shell design,"Biomimicry has been proposed as an important tool to reach key skills for the new century. It has taken its place as an essential resource for critical and creative thinking in design disciplines. However, as emphasized in many studies, bio-informed research requires interdisciplinary collaboration and systematic knowledge transfer. This article answers the question: “How can architects-who have limited knowledge in biology-develop biomimetic ideas and transfer this knowledge to architectural designs?” This research's hypothesis is that the “natural language approach,” which is frequently used in engineering disciplines, can also be a knowledge transfer tool for the architectural discipline. To test the hypothesis, research was conducted with a group of graduate students taking the “ARCH5661-Parametric Approach to Nature-Inspired Architectures” course in the Department of Architecture, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey, in the fall semester of 2019. The results were evaluated based on term-long studies and feedback from the students. In light of the obtained data, this article proposes a method that can be used in architectural education and adapted to other design disciplines.",2021,"Arslan Selcuk, Semra; Mutlu Avinc, Gunes",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION,Architecture education; Bio-informed architecture; Nature language approach; Shell design
Design for invention: annotation of functional geometry interaction for representing novel working principles,In some mechanical engineering devices the novelty or inventive step of a patented design relies heavily upon how geometric features contribute to device functions. Communicating the functional interactions between geometric features in existing patented designs may increase a designer's awareness of the prior art and thereby avoid conflict with their emerging design. This paper shows how functional representations of geometry interactions can be developed from patent claims to produce novel semantic graphical and text annotations of patent drawings. The approach provides a quick and accurate means for the designer to understand the patent that is well suited to the designer's natural way of understanding the device. Through several example application cases we show the application of a detailed representation of functional geometry interactions that captures the working principle of familiar mechanical engineering devices described in patents. A computer tool that is being developed to assist the designer to understand prior art is also described.,2018,"Atherton, M; Jiang, PF; Harrison, D; Malizia, A",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Function analysis diagram; Functional interactions; Functional representation; Geometric features; Prior art; Semantics; Working principle; OF-THE-LITERATURE; MODELS
Predicting Design Performance Utilizing Automated Topic Discovery,"Increasingly complex engineering design challenges requires the diversification of knowledge required on design teams. In the context of open innovation, positioning key members within these teams or groups based on their estimated abilities leads to more impactful results since mass collaboration is fundamentally a sociotechnical system. Determining how each individual influences the overall design process requires an understanding of the predicted mapping between their technical competency and performance. This work explores this relationship through the use of predictive models composed of various algorithms. With support of a dataset composed of documents related to the design performance of students working on their capstone design project in combination with textual descriptors representing individual technical aptitudes, correlations are explored as a method to predict overall project development performance. Each technical competency and project is represented as a distribution of topic knowledge to produce the performance metrics, which are referred to as topic competencies, since topic representations increase the ability to decompose and identify human-centric performance measures. Three methods of topic identification and five prediction models are compared based on their prediction accuracy. From this analysis, it is found that representing input variables as topics distributions and the resulting performance as a single indicator while using support vector regression provided the most accurate mapping between ability and performance. With these findings, complex open innovation projects will benefit from increased knowledge of individual ability and how that correlates to their predicted performances.",2020,"Ball, Z; Lewis, K",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,collaborative design; design teams; text analysis; CLASSIFICATION; PARTICIPATION; COMPETENCES; SYSTEMS
Representation of heterogeneous material properties in the Core Product Model,"The Core Product Model (CPM) was developed at National Institute of Standards as a high level abstraction for representing product related information, to support data exchange, in a distributive and a collaborative environment. In this paper, we extend the CPM to components with continuously varying material properties. Such components are becoming increasing important and popular due to progress in design, analysis and manufacturing techniques. The key enabling concept for modeling continuously varying material properties is that of distance fields associated with a set of material features, where values and rates of material properties are specified. Material fields, representing distribution of material properties within a component, are usually expressed as functions of distances to material features, and are controlled with a variety of differential, integral or algebraic constraints. Our formulation is independent of any particular platform or representation, and applies to most proposed techniques for representing continuously varying material properties. The proposed model is described using Unified Modeling Language and is illustrated through a number of specific examples.",2008,"Biswas, Arpan; Fenves, Steve J.; Shapiro, Vadim; Sriram, Ram",ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS,;
Predicting topic shift locations in design histories,"Knowing the locations of weak-to-strong topic shifts in a design history enables hierarchical segmentation of that history. The segmentation can be the basis of hierarchical visualization, that is, semantic zoom, and more, such as visualization of co-location, co-citation, and density of linking. This research shows that a fine-grained, sub-topical linkograph of a design conversation can be used to identify the locations of topic shifts in that conversation. A design conversation spanning 11 design meetings was captured; deictic (pointing-like) references were simulated by performing a sentence-by-sentence-level linkograph analysis of the conversation (that is, the conversation was not subjectively aggregated to topical segments prior to analysis); an algorithm used the linkograph to predict the locations of topic shifts; and the linkograph-predicted topic shift locations were compared with expected topic shift locations for the same conversation. The expected topic shift locations were defined as the heads of reference series (references to transcript units) that were made in a detailed report about the meetings. The model performed well (63-80 %) on large reference series (quartiles three and four) and poorly on small reference series (quartiles one and two, and singular references). Future research will work with linkographs that are automatically constructed by both text-based and graphic design systems and aim to develop a framework that can adapt to individual histories.",2013,"Botta, D; Woodbury, R",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Design history analysis; Linkograph analysis; Discourse analysis; Topical segmentation; 
A novel systematic method to evaluate computer-supported collaborative design technologies,"Selection of suitable computer-supported collaborative design (CSCD) technologies is crucial to facilitate successful projects. This paper presents the first systematic method for engineering design teams to evaluate and select the most suitable CSCD technologies comparing technology functionality and project requirements established in peer-reviewed literature. The paper first presents 220 factors that influence successful CSCD. These factors were then systematically mapped and categorised to create CSCD requirement statements. The novel evaluation and selection method incorporates these requirement statements within a matrix and develops a discourse analysis text processing algorithm with data from collaborative projects to automate the population of how technologies impact the success of CSCD in engineering design teams. This method was validated using data collected across 3 years of a student global design project. The impact of this method is the potential to change the way engineering design teams consider the technology they use and how the selection of appropriate tools impacts the success of their CSCD projects. The development of the CSCD evaluation matrix is the first of its kind enabling a systematic and justifiable comparison and technology selection, with the aim of best supporting the engineering designers collaborative design activity.",2020,"Brisco, R; Whitfield, RI; Grierson, H",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Computer-supported collaborative design (CSCD); Engineering design; Computer-aided engineering and design; Collaboration; Educational tools; SOCIAL NETWORK SITES; COMMUNICATION; STUDENTS; ONLINE; TEAMS
Computer-aided mind map generation via crowdsourcing and machine learning,"Early-stage ideation is a critical step in the design process. Mind maps are a popular tool for generating design concepts and in general for hierarchically organizing design insights. We explore an application for high-level concept synthesis in early stage design, which is typically difficult due to the broad space of options in early stages (e.g., as compared to parametric automation tools which are typically applicable in concept refinement stages or detail design). However, developing a useful mind map often demands a considerable time investment from a diverse design team. To facilitate the process of creating mind maps, we present an approach to crowdsourcing both concepts and binning of said concepts, using a mix of human evaluators and machine learning. The resulting computer-aided mind map has a significantly higher average concept novelty, and no significant difference in average feasibility (quantity can be set independently) as manually generated mind maps, includes distinct concepts, and reduces cost in terms of the designers' time. This approach has the potential to make early-stage ideation faster, scalable and parallelizable, while creating alternative approaches to searching for a breadth and diversity of ideas. Emerging research explores the use of machine learning and other advanced computational techniques to amplify the mind mapping process. This work demonstrates the use of the both the EM-SVD, and HDBSCAN algorithms in an inferential clustering approach to reduce the number of one-to-one comparisons required in forming clusters of concepts. Crowdsourced human effort assists the process for both concept generation and clustering in the mind map. This process provides a viable approach to augment ideation methods, reduces the workload on a design team, and thus provides an efficient and useful machine learning based clustering approach.",2020,"Camburn, B; Arlitt, R; Anderson, D; Sanaei, R; Raviselam, S; Jensen, D; Wood, KL",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Mind map; Ideation; Concept generation; Machine learning; Crowdsourcing; Bradley Camburn; 
Machine Learning-Based Design Concept Evaluation,"In order to develop novel solutions for complex systems and in increasingly competitive markets, it may be advantageous to generate large numbers of design concepts and then to identify the most novel and valuable ideas. However, it can be difficult to process, review, and assess thousands of design concepts. Based on this need, we develop and demonstrate an automated method for design concept assessment. In the method, machine learning technologies are first applied to extract ontological data from design concepts. Then, a filtering strategy and quantitative metrics are introduced that enable creativity rating based on the ontological data. This method is tested empirically. Design concepts are crowd-generated for a variety of actual industry design problems/opportunities. Over 4000 design concepts were generated by humans for assessment. Empirical evaluation assesses: (1) correspondence of the automated ratings with human creativity ratings; (2) whether concepts selected using the method are highly scored by another set of crowd raters; and finally (3) if high scoring designs have a positive correlation or relationship to industrial technology development. The method provides a possible avenue to rate design concepts deterministically. A highlight is that a subset of designs selected automatically out of a large set of candidates was scored higher than a subset selected by humans when evaluated by a set of third-party raters. The results hint at bias in human design concept selection and encourage further study in this topic.",2020,"Camburn, B; He, YJ; Raviselvam, S; Luo, JX; Wood, K",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,artificial intelligence; collaborative design; conceptual design; creativity and concept generation; design automation; ARCHITECTURE; METRICS
Design creativity and the semantic analysis of conversations in the design studio,"The analysis of conversations during design activity can facilitate deeper insights into design thinking and its relation to creativity. A semantic analysis approach was employed to explore the semantic content of communication and information exchange between students and instructors. The goal was to examine design conversations in terms of abstraction, Polysemy, Information Content, and Semantic Similarity measures, and analyze their relation to the creativity of final solutions. These design outcomes were assessed according to their Originality, Usability, Feasibility, Overall Value, and Overall Creativity. Consequently, 35 design conversations from the 10th Design Thinking Research Symposium (DTRS10) dataset were analyzed. The main results showed that Information Content and Semantic Similarity predicted Originality, and Information Content alone predicted Overall Creativity. Likewise, Abstraction predicted Feasibility, while Semantic Similarity, Information Content, and Polysemy predicted Overall Value. In context of instructors, Semantic Similarity predicted Usability, and Polysemy predicted Feasibility. For students, Semantic Similarity predicted Overall Value. On the whole, Semantic Similarity and Information Content were the most prolific measures, and therefore could be considered for promoting creativity in the design studio. The implications of using support tools such as automated systems are also discussed.",2021,"Casakin, H; Georgiev, GV",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION,Design creativity measures; semantic measures; semantic analysis; design education; design conversations; 
Functional grouping of natural language requirements for assistance in architectural software design,"Modern software systems are becoming larger and more complex every day. One of the most challenging steps for designing a good architecture for a certain piece of software is the analysis of requirements, usually written in natural language by engineers not familiar with specific design formalisms. The main problem related to this task is the conceptual gap existing between low-level requirements and higher views of the system decomposing its functionality. In this paper, we introduce an approach for mining and grouping functionality from textual descriptions of requirements using text mining techniques aiming at helping software designers with this complex and time-consuming task. The knowledge discovered starting from informally written requirements using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and text clustering algorithms can be then easily mapped into design concerns of a possible architecture for the system. Experimental validation in three case studies suggests a great potential of the proposed approach for providing assistance to software designers during early stages of the software development process.

Plastics design: integrating TRIZ creativity and semantic knowledge portals,"Polymers are substituting metallic alloys in every field of mechanical application; in plastics design the material properties affect designer's choice more heavily than in other cases, but also available manufacturing technologies have a deep influence on the project. All of these considerations can be summarized in the concept that a wide knowledge of polymer behaviour and technology is required and that in plastics design a new approach should be used: so new design tools must be adopted, as creativity supporting software, integrated with the prototyping capabilities offered by computer-aided engineering systems, to guide the development of new solutions. The aim of this work is to show how the integration of modern design tools with creativity management techniques constitutes an effective procedure to enhance the capability of developing innovative products. In this paper the use of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is proposed to approach the redesign of structural parts from metals to polymers. To supply the designer with all the information he/she may need in this activity, a knowledge portal based on semantic capabilities of modern text mining technology has been built: the design of a polymeric wheel is taken as the opportunity to show how these design tools can organize and conduct to realizable solutions. The integrated adoption of knowledge-based tools both for the conceptual design phase (TRIZ-based applications) and for the detailed design phase (Semantic Knowledge portal) has provided satisfactory results in terms of augmented creativity and design efficiency.",2004,"Cascini, G; Rissone, P",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,;
SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNICAL TEXTS,"We explored the problem of achieving in-depth understanding of natural language sentences from narrative technical reports through knowledge-based free text understanding. We rely on the assumption that texts in an expert domain convey much implicit information, which can be recovered by building and reasoning on a model of the situation described with the help of both linguistic and detailed world knowledge. We describe a two-step approach to semantic analysis: the first step assembles a conceptual representation of a sentence and deals with linguistic issues; the second step actually builds and runs the situational model and is totally dedicated to representation and inference. We evaluated this approach by designing a research prototype that processes sentences from clinical narratives in a medical specialty. This proto-type was fully implemented and was tested on actual sentences. We hereby give a detailed account of this implementation as well as the first results obtained.",1994,"CAVAZZA, M; ZWEIGENBAUM, P",APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,;
Data-Driven Sizing Specification Utilizing Consumer Text Reviews,"The objective of this work is to introduce a new method for determining preliminary design specifications related to human-artifact interaction. This new method uses data mining of large numbers of consumer reviews. User opinion on specific product features can be time-consuming or expensive to obtain through traditional methods including surveys, experiments, and observational studies. Data mining review text of already released products may be a potentially less time consuming and costly method. Previously established methods of determining design for human variability information from consumer reviews, such as the frequency and accuracy summation (FAS) number and subsequent manual analysis, are explored. The weighted phrase rating (WPR), a new metric which can be an automated tool to quickly analyze consumer reviews, is also introduced. It does not require manual parsing of the reviews, which extends its applicability to larger review pools. This new method is shown to quickly and economically provide information useful to the establishment of design specifications.",2017,"Chaklader, R; Parkinson, MB",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS; DESIGN
A functional representation for aiding biomimetic and artificial inspiration of new ideas,"Inspiration is useful for exploration and discovery of new solution spaces. Systems in natural and artificial worlds and their functionality are seen as rich sources of inspiration for idea generation. However, unlike in the artificial domain where existing systems are often used for inspiration, those from the natural domain are rarely used in a systematic way for this purpose. Analogy is long regarded as a powerful means for inspiring novel idea generation. One aim of the work reported here is to initiate similar work in the area of systematic biomimetics for product development, so that inspiration from both natural and artificial worlds can be used systematically to help develop novel, analogical ideas for solving design problems. A generic model for representing causality of natural and artificial systems has been developed, and used to structure information in a database of systems from both the domains. These are implemented in a piece of software for automated analogical search of relevant ideas from the databases to solve a given problem. Preliminary experiments at validating the software indicate substantial potential for the approach.",2005,"Chakrabarti, A; Sarkar, P; Leelavathamma, B; Nataraju, BS",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,idea generation; inspiration; design by analogy; behavioral language; biomimicry
Function in device representation,"We explore the meanings of the terms `structure', `behaviour', and, especially, `function' in engineering practice. Computers provide great assistance in calculation tasks in engineering practice, but they also have great potential for helping with reasoning tasks. However, realising this vision requires precision in representing engineering knowledge, in which the terms mentioned above play a central role. We start with a simple ontology for representing objects and causal interactions between objects. Using this ontology, up investigate a range of meanings for the terms of interest. Specifically, we distinguish between function as effect on the environment, and a device-centred view of device function. In the former view, function is seen as an intended or desired role that an artifact plays in its environment. We identify an important concept called mode of deployment that is often left implicit, but whose explicit representation is necessary for correct and complete reasoning. We discuss the task of design and design verification in this framework. We end with a discussion that relates needs in the world to functions of artifacts created to satisfy the needs.",2000,"Chandrasekaran, B; Josephson, JR",ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS,functional reasoning; device ontology; functional representation; causal reasoning; compositional modeling; device simulation
Product concept evaluation and selection using data mining and domain ontology in a crowdsourcing environment,"For product design and development, crowdsourcing shows huge potential for fostering creativity and has been regarded as one important approach to acquiring innovative concepts. Nevertheless, prior to the approach could be effectively implemented, the following challenges concerning crowdsourcing should be properly addressed: (1) burdensome concept review process to deal with a large amount of crowd-sourced design concepts; (2) insufficient consideration in integrating design knowledge and principles into existing data processing methods! algorithms for crowdsourcing; and (3) lack of a quantitative decision support process to identify better concepts. To tackle these problems, a product concept evaluation and selection approach, which comprises three modules, is proposed. These modules are respectively: (1) a data mining module to extract meaningful information from online crowd-sourced concepts; (2) a concept re-construction module to organize word tokens into a unified frame using domain ontology and extended design knowledge; and (3) a decision support module to select better concepts in a simplified manner. A pilot study on future PC (personal computer) design was conducted to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is promising and may help to improve the concept review and evaluation efficiency; facilitate data processing using design knowledge; and enhance the reliability of concept selection decisions.

A product affective properties identification approach based on web mining in a crowdsourcing environment,"Affective product design, which aims to satisfy customer feelings as an aspect of product quality, has attracted more and more research attention. However, conventional product design relies on surveys and user experiments to collect user evaluations, which leads to the issues that (i) consumers can only express their feelings on design attributes specified by assigners; (ii) abundant online consumer resources are neglected; and (iii) a lack of further prioritisation and re-construction of affective design properties. This study aims to develop a product affective properties identification approach. Crowdsourcing platforms have the advantage of obtaining large numbers of free consumer comments and have been utilised as data sources. Web mining and text mining are deployed to capture the crowdsourced product review resources. Then product design knowledge hierarchy is established to find design properties, while sentiment analysis was undertaken to identify affections. With the help of domain ontology to connect design properties and corresponding affections, product affective properties can be identified. Furthermore, the identified affective properties are prioritised, so as to assist in design improvement and support decision making. To illustrate the proposed approach, a pilot study on iPhone 7 was conducted, in which influential affective properties have been identified and ranked.",2018,"Chang, DN; Lee, C",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Product affective property; crowdsourcing; web mining; product design knowledge hierarchy; domain ontology; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMOTIONAL DESIGN; AFFECTIVE RESPONSES; FORM DESIGN; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SEMANTIC WEB; ROUGH SET; ONTOLOGY; QUALITY
A linguistic representation based approach to modelling Kansei data and its application to consumer-oriented evaluation of traditional products,"This paper aims at introducing a new method for Kansei data modelling, which is basically based on the linguistic interpretation of Kansei data and the probabilistic semantics of fuzzy sets. We first interpret a semantic differential scale used in Kansei experiment as a linguistic variable and then propose a new method of how the Kansei value of products can be represented as a probability distribution on the set of Kansei linguistic labels of the linguistic variable. We further extend this Kansei data modelling approach to the cases where the Kansei value is imprecisely given as an interval or a fuzzy number. Furthermore, the proposed approach for modelling Kansei data will be used to develop a target-based model for consumer-oriented evaluation. Finally, a case study for consumer-oriented evaluation of hand painted Kutani cups, a traditional product in Ishikawa, Japan, is conducted to show the applicability of the proposed Kansei data modelling approach.

A structure-function knowledge extraction method for bio-inspired design,"Bio-inspired design is an innovative design method that uses analogies to biological systems to develop solutions for engineering problems. It offers a huge potential to produce innovative concepts. However, most designers face difficulties in extracting design knowledge from biological information. This paper proposes a structure-function knowledge extraction method, which combines dependency parsing and keyword extraction. The dependency parsing computes dependency relations between pairs of words in a sentence. Through the specific types of dependency relations, the potential knowledge including structures and functions can be identified. The keyword extraction is to obtain the terms that represent the subject of biological information. These terms target on filtering the identified knowledge, which ensures that the extracted structures and functions are all related to the subject. Among them, the structures and functions with association relationships are further combined into structure-function knowledge. The proposed method is preliminarily evaluated based on randomly selected test samples, and the result indicates that the method would be a promising alternative to extract structure-function knowledge. In addition, a case study illustrates the application of extracted structure-function knowledge in the improvement design of fan noise reduction. To verify the impact of the method on bio-inspired design, we conducted an experiment with three different groups. It demonstrates that the method can save the time of extracting design knowledge and provide the potentiality of generating novel ideas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Ontology-based requirement verification for complex systems,"Verification is a necessary part of Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) which is becoming a mainstream methodology for the design of complex systems. Verification in the early design stage has aroused widespread attention for its efficiency and cost-saving. Although there are numbers of researches on verification, some deficiencies still exist, such as the integration of design and verification needs to improve, the design problems are hard to trace and the behavior verification in the early design stage is often omitted. In this study, a novel ontology-based requirement verification method for complex systems is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems. First, a requirement formalization method is proposed to avoid the ambiguousness of natural language, to make requirements easier to verify, and to make design problems easier to trace. Second, some transformation rules are defined to realize the automatic design ontology and rule generation. Based on these two steps, automated verification can be done through reasoning with ontology models and rules. This verification method is fully integrated with design tools and no additional expertise is needed for designers. To validate its feasibility and advantages, an example of a smart traffic light system is provided.",2020,"Chen, Ruirui; Chen, Chun-Hsien; Liu, Yusheng; Ye, Xiaoping",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Ontology; Reasoning; Systems design; Verification
Investigating a Mixed-Initiative Workflow for Digital Mind-Mapping,"In this paper, we report on our investigation of human-AI collaboration for mind-mapping. We specifically focus on problem exploration in pre-conceptualization stages of early design. Our approach leverages the notion of query expansion-the process of refining a given search query for improving information retrieval. Assuming a mind-map as a network of nodes, we reformulate its construction process as a sequential interaction workflow wherein a human user and an intelligent agent take turns to add one node to the network at a time. Our contribution is the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithm that powers the intelligent agent (IA). This paper is an extension of our prior work (Chen et al., 2019, Mini-Map: Mixed-Initiative Mind-Mapping Via Contextual Query Expansion, AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum, p. 2347) wherein we developed this algorithm, dubbed Mini-Map, and implemented a web-based workflow enabled by ConceptNet (a large graph-based representation of commonsense knowledge). In this paper, we extend our prior work through a comprehensive comparison between human-AI collaboration and human-human collaboration for mind-mapping.

In order to resolve this problem, a more efficient cockpit emotion evaluation system is established in the present study to simply and quickly obtain the cockpit emotion evaluation value. To this end, the neural network is applied to construct an emotional model to evaluate the emotional prediction of the interior design of the aircraft cockpit. Moreover, several technologies and the Kansei engineering method are applied to acquire the cockpit interior emotional evaluation data for typical aircraft models. In this regard, the radical basis function neural network (RBFNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and the general regression neural network (GRNN) are applied to construct the sentimental prediction evaluation model. Then, the three models are comprehensively compared through factors such as the model evaluation criteria, network structure, and network parameters. Obtained experimental results indicate that the GRNN not only has the highest classification accuracy but also has the highest stability in comparison to the other two neural networks, so that it is a more appropriate method for the emotional evaluation of the aircraft cockpit. Results of the present study provide decision supports for the emotional evaluation of the cockpit interior space.",2021,"Chen, YH; Yu, SH; Chu, JJ; Chen, DK; Yu, MJ",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Aircraft cockpit interior; emotional evaluation model; Kansei engineering; neural network prediction; 
Biologically Meaningful Keywords for Functional Terms of the Functional Basis,"Biology is recognized as an excellent source of analogies and stimuli for engineering design. Previous work focused on the systematic identification of relevant biological analogies by searching for instances of functional keywords in biological information in natural-language format. This past work revealed that engineering keywords could not always be used to identify the most relevant biological analogies as the vocabularies between biology and engineering are sufficiently distinct. Therefore, a retrieval algorithm was developed to identify potential biologically meaningful keywords that are more effective in searching biological text than corresponding engineering keywords. In our current work, we applied and refined the retrieval algorithm to translate functional terms of the functional basis into biologically meaningful keywords. The functional basis is widely accepted as a standardized representation of engineering product functionality. Therefore, our keywords could serve as a thesaurus for engineers to find biological analogies relevant to their design problems. We also describe specific semantic relationships that can be used to identify biologically meaningful keywords in excerpts describing biological phenomena. These semantic relations were applied as criteria to identify the most useful biologically meaningful keywords. Through a preliminary validation experiment, we observed that different translators were able to apply the criteria to identify biologically meaningful keywords with a high degree of agreement to those identified by the authors. In addition, we describe how fourth-year undergraduate mechanical engineering students used the biologically meaningful keywords to develop concepts for their design projects.

Automated Extraction of Function Knowledge From Text,"This paper presents a method to automatically extract function knowledge from natural language text. The extraction method uses syntactic rules to acquire subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets from parsed text. Then, the functional basis taxonomy, WordNet, and word2vec are utilized to classify the triplets as artifact-function-energy flow knowledge. For evaluation, the function definitions associated with 30 most frequent artifacts compiled in a human-constructed knowledge base, Oregon State University's design repository (DR), were compared to the definitions identified by extraction the method from 4953 Wikipedia pages classified under the category Machines. The method found function definitions for 66% of the test artifacts. For those artifacts found, 50% of the function definitions identified were compiled in the DR. In addition, 75% of the most frequent function definitions found by the method were also defined in the DR. The results demonstrate the potential of the current work in enabling automated construction of function knowledge repositories.",2017,"Cheong, H; Li, W; Cheung, A; Nogueira, A; Iorio, F",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; FUTURE; ROM
Retrieving Causally Related Functions From Natural-Language Text for Biomimetic Design,"Identifying biological analogies is a significant challenge in biomimetic (biologically inspired) design. This paper builds on our previous work on finding biological phenomena in natural-language text. Specifically, a rule-based computational technique is used to identify biological analogies that contain causal relations. Causally related functions describe how one function is enabled by another function, and support the transfer of functional structure from analogies to design solutions. The causal-relation retrieval method uses patterns of syntactic information that represent causally related functions in individual sentences, and scored F-measures of 0.73-0.85. In a user study, novice designers found that of the total search matches, proportionally more of the matches obtained with the causal-relation retrieval method were relevant to design problems than those obtained with a single verb-keyword search. In addition, matches obtained with the causal-relation retrieval method increased the likelihood of using functional association to develop design concepts. Finally, the causal-relation retrieval method enables automatic extraction of biological analogies at the sentence level from a large amount of natural-language sources, which could support other approaches to biologically inspired design that require the identification of interesting biological phenomena.",2014,"Cheong, H; Shu, LH",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,biomimetic design; biologically inspired design; conceptual design; creativity and concept generation; SIMILARITY; CONSTRAINT; SYSTEM
Data science for engineering design: State of the art and future directions,"Engineering design (ED) is the process of solving technical problems within requirements and constraints to create new artifacts. Data science (DS) is the inter-disciplinary field that uses computational systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data. The synergies between these two fields have a long story and throughout the past decades, ED has increasingly benefited from an integration with DS. We present a literature review at the intersection between ED and DS, identifying the tools, algorithms and data sources that show the most potential in contributing to ED, and identifying a set of challenges that future data scientists and designers should tackle, to maximize the potential of DS in supporting effective and efficient designs. A rigorous scoping review approach has been supported by Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to offer a review of research across two fuzzy-confining disciplines. The paper identifies challenges related to the two fields of research and to their interfaces. The main gaps in the literature revolve around the adaptation of computational techniques to be applied in the peculiar context of design, the identification of data sources to boost design research and a proper featurization of this data. The challenges have been classified considering their impacts on ED phases and applicability of DS methods, giving a map for future research across the fields. The scoping review shows that to fully take advantage of DS tools there must be an increase in the collaboration between design practitioners and researchers in order to open new data driven opportunities.

Technical Sentiment Analysis. Measuring Advantages and Drawbacks of New Products Using Social Media,"The paper contributes to the literature on sentiment analysis by introducing a new knowledge-based lexicon. The lexicon, based on fundamental research and systematic practice in Engineering Design, describes the Advantages or Drawbacks (Disadvantages) of products as an effect of the interaction between artifacts and users. The paper extracts data from Twitter that report consumer conversations after the launch of new products in the videogame industry. It compares the results of a traditional sentiment analysis with the results filtered using the lexicon. We observe a drop in the number of positive tweets but a sharp increase in the informativeness of consumers' opinions. Comments filtered using the lexicon offer a much more useful basis for understanding customers and designing new products. The paper develops several areas of potential applicability of the methodology. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Biomimetic design through natural language analysis to facilitate cross-domain information retrieval,"Biomimetic, or biologically inspired, design uses analogous biological phenomena to develop solutions for engineering problems. Several instances of biomimetic design result from personal observations of biological phenomena. However, many engineers' knowledge of biology may be limited, thus reducing the potential of biologically inspired solutions. Our approach to biomimetic design takes advantage of the large amount of biological knowledge already available in books, journals, and so forth, by performing keyword searches on these existing natural-language sources. Because of the ambiguity and imprecision of natural language, challenges inherent to natural language processing were encountered. One challenge of retrieving relevant cross-domain information involves differences in domain vocabularies, or lexicons. A keyword meaningful to biologists may not occur to engineers. For an example problem that involved cleaning, that is, removing dirt, a biochemist suggested the keyword defend. Defend is not an obvious keyword to most engineers for this problem, nor are the words defend and clean/remove directly related within lexical references. However, previous work showed that biological phenomena retrieved by the keyword defend provided useful stimuli and produced successful concepts for the clean/remove problem. In this paper, we describe a method to systematically bridge the disparate biology and engineering domains using natural language analysis. For the clean/remove example, we were able to algorithmically generate several biologically meaningful keywords, including defend, that are not obviously related to the engineering problem. We developed a method to organize and rank the set of biologically meaningful keywords identified, and confirmed that we could achieve similar results for two other examples in encapsulation and microassembly. Although we specifically address cross-domain information retrieval from biology, the bridging process presented in this paper is not limited to biology, and can be used for any other domain given the availability of appropriate domain-specific knowledge sources and references.",2007,"Chiu, I; Shu, LH",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,biomimetic; biologically inspired; bioanalogous design; concept generation; domain lexicons; information retrieval; ASSOCIATION; GENERATION
Investigating effects of oppositely related semantic stimuli on design concept creativity,"We are motivated to investigate methods to increase creativity in conceptual design since creativity is essential to design success, and no other stage influences final design success as much as conceptual design. Existing work supports that design stimuli may encourage creative concept generation, but does not give details on how to systematically generate stimuli. The established relationship between language and cognition, and the systematic nature of language prompt us to examine its use as design stimuli. Language relationships such as opposition provide a systematic method of generating non-obvious semantic stimuli for design problems. In this paper, we present two experiments, a pen-and-paper and a verbal protocol study, where participants used oppositely related and similarly related word stimuli in conceptual design. We found that designers using oppositely related word stimuli developed more creative concepts. Language analysis revealed how opposite stimuli elicited designer behaviours that may encourage and support creative concept generation. Our empirical results combined with linguistic theory lead us to propose a model explaining the interactions and effects of opposite-stimulus words on concept creativity. This knowledge can be used to facilitate more creative, and ultimately, more successful design.",2012,"Chiu, I; Shu, LH",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,language; creativity; design stimuli; concept generation; engineering design; ENGINEERING DESIGN; DECISION-MAKING; LANGUAGE; GENERATION; IMPACT
Utilizing text mining and Kansei Engineering to support data-driven design automation at conceptual design stage,"Purpose: The purpose of this research was to develop a case-based method for analyzing online customer reviews and extracting customer preferences through an integration of text mining and Kansei Engineering (KE) in an effort to achieve conceptual data-driven design automation and to successfully identify future trends in a particular consumer product. Design/Methodology/Approach This study's model merges text mining and KE to extract key descriptive Kansei terminology according to actual customer reviews and use it to forecast consumer preferred product design while reducing certain repetitious tasks of designers. This work first collects online product reviews using text mining. Then, through the application of KE, the customer-preferred design components are identified and incorporated into the product design specifications. Finally, an Application Programming Interface (API) is developed to automatically generate a CAD preliminary design. Case Study A road bike case study is provided to demonstrate the practicality of proposed method. The online reviews are collected from Amazon.com. The related design elements are classified into six key components which can be modified in the proposed conceptual design automation system. Originality/value This is the first paper that has applied text mining and KE for use in product development. This work can also reduce the time and cost of product design through the automation of repetitive design tasks. The conceptual design automation system is valuable for designers wishing to identify customer needs and to generate engineering drawings in a timely manner without significant repetition during the design process.",2018,"Chiu, Ming-Chuan; Lin, Kong-Zhao",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Design automation; Text mining; Kansei Engineering; Data-driven design; Product development process
A Kansei evaluation approach based on the technique of computing with words,"Kansei evaluation plays a vital role in the implementation of Kansei engineering; however, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate customer preferences of a product's Kansei attributes as such preferences involve human perceptual interpretation with certain subjectivity, uncertainty, and imprecision. An effective Kansei evaluation requires justifying the classification of Kansei attributes extracted from a set of collected Kansei words, establishing priorities for customer preferences of product alternatives with respect to each attribute, and synthesizing the priorities for the evaluated alternatives. Moreover, psychometric Kansei evaluation systems essentially require dealing with Kansei words. This paper presents a Kansei evaluation approach based on the technique of computing with words (CWW). The aims of this study were (1) to classify collected Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes by using cluster analysis based on fuzzy relations; (2) to model Kansei preferences based on semantic labels for the priority analysis; and (3) to synthesize priority information and rank the order of decision alternatives by means of the linguistic aggregation operation. An empirical study is presented to demonstrate the implementation process and applicability of the proposed Kansei evaluation approach. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed approach are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Word graphs in architectural design,"In computer-aided architectural design, words are an underemployed source of information. Through a series of case studies, we deduced a design annotation data model. All entities in this model can be captured from the design draft, except one: the word relation. Therefore, a system was developed that generates word graphs using single words from the draft as input. The system searches for semantic relations between words and for new intermediate words that can connect two existing words. The system has filters that select only those graphs that are considered interesting by the designers. The envisioned applications of word graphs in the context of computer-aided architectural design are to contribute to the architect's design and to enhance the fluency of the design. These expectations are met, but must be considered in relation to the architect's drafting behavior.",2005,"De Vries, B; Jessurun, J; Segers, N; Achten, H",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,computer-aided design; design semantics; word associations
Linguistic support for concept selection decisions,"Affective engineering is being increasingly used to describe a systematic approach to the analysis of consumer reactions to candidate designs. It has evolved from Kansei engineering, which has reported improvements in products such as cars, electronics, and food. The method includes a semantic differential experiment rating candidate designs against bipolar adjectives (e.g., attractive-not attractive, traditional-not traditional). The results are statistically analyzed to identify correlations between design features and consumer reactions to inform future product developments. A number of key challenges emerge from this process. Clearly, suitable designs must be available to cover all design possibilities. However, it is also paramount that the best adjectives are used to reflect the judgments that participants might want to make. The current adjective selection process is unsystematic, and could potentially miss key concepts. Poor adjective choices can result in problems such as misinterpretation of an experimental question, clustering of results around a particular response, and participants' confusion from unfamiliar adjectives that can be difficult to consider in the required context (e.g., is this wristwatch oppressive?). This paper describes an artificial intelligence supported process that ensures adjectives with appropriate levels of precision and recall are developed and presented to participants (and thus addressing problems above) in an affective engineering study in the context of branded consumer goods. We illustrate our description of the entire concept expansion and reduction process by means of an industrial case study in which participants were asked to evaluate different designs of packaging for a laundry product. The paper concludes by describing the important advantages that can be gained by the new approach in comparison with previous approaches to the selection of consumer focused adjectives.",2007,"Delin, J; Sharoff, S; Lillford, S; Barnes, C",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,adjective rules; affective engineering; concept evaluation; Kansei engineering; semantic differential experiment; 
Faces of Product Pleasure: 25 Positive Emotions in Human-Product Interactions,"The study of user emotions is hindered by the absence of a clear overview of what positive emotions can be experienced in human-product interactions. Existing typologies are either too concise or too comprehensive, including less than five or hundreds of positive emotions, respectively. To overcome this hindrance, this paper introduces a basic set of 25 positive emotion types that represent the general repertoire of positive human emotions. The set was developed with a componential analysis of 150 positive emotion words. A questionnaire study that explored how and when each of the 25 emotions are experienced in human-product interactions resulted in a collection of 729 example cases. On the basis of these cases, six main sources of positive emotions in human-product interactions are proposed. By providing a fine-grained yet concise vocabulary of positive emotions that people can experience in response to product design, the typology aims to facilitate both research and design activities. The implications and limitations of the set are discussed, and some future research steps are proposed.",2012,"Desmet, PMA",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN,Emotion-Driven Design; Positive Emotions; Questionnaire Research; JUDGMENTS
The integration of lightweight representation and annotation for collaborative design representation,"Today companies face the unprecedented challenges of a global market, collaborative environments and the concept of management of the entire product life cycle. In supporting this, the challenge is not only how to utilize information management policies, but also how to develop product representation methods to meet the new demands including platform/application independence, support for the product lifecycle, assisting generation of viewpoint-specific representations, rapid sharing of information between geographically distributed applications and users, and protection of commercial security (intellectual property). This paper proposes a product representation approach using the strengths of lightweight representation and annotation and markup practices to allow the association of product data from throughout the lifecycle with the geometric form of the product. The approach, called Lightweight Model with Multi-layer Annotation (LIMMA), integrates the concept of lightweight representation with annotation of boundary-representations (b-rep) of a product and the use of a formalised markup language (XML). Examples of annotation layers and development of models through-life are given, based on the LIMMA approach.",2009,"Ding, L; Davies, D; McMahon, C",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Lightweight representation; Annotation; Markup method; Product Lifecycle Management (PLM); CAD model; FEATURE RECOGNITION; FEATURES; SYSTEMS; FORM
Concept formation as knowledge accumulation: A computational linguistics study,"Language plays at least two role; in design. First, language serves as representations of ideas and concepts through linguistic behaviors that represeni the structure of thought during the design process. Second, language also performs actions and creates states of affairs. Based on these two perspectives on language use in design, we apply the computational linguistics tools of latent semantic analysis and lexical chain analysis to characterize how design teams engage in concept formation as the accumulation of knowledge represented by lexicalized concepts. The accumulation is described in a data structure comprised by a set of links between elemental lexicalized concepts. The folding together of these two perspectives on language use in design with the information processing theories of the mind afforded by the computational linguistics tools applied creates a new means to evaluate concept formation in design teams. The method suggests that analysis at a linguistic level can characterize concept formation even where process-oriented critiques were limited in their ability to uncover a formal design method that could explain the phenomenon.",2006,"Dong, A",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,concept formation; design language; latent semantic analysis; lexical chain analysis; LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; SYSTEMS
The enactment of design through language,"If designers engage in a conversation with the situation they are shaping as Donald Schon theorizes,how is design materialized through these conversations? If language metonymically refers to design by intertwining with designers in an ontological circuit of recognition that harnesses and represents that which can be conversed and said, does language itself participate in the enactment of design? This article introduces the performative aspects of the language of design, aggregation, accumulation, and appraisal. Forms of semantics and grammatical structures of design text are lines of compositions through which these performance aspects enact design practice and actualize the designed work. Reviews, of theories of performativity and empirical studies of the language of design show a connection between what is said and written about designing and the productive force of language.

The latent semantic approach to studying design team communication,"How does a team of designers come to construct knowledge about the artefact that they're designing? This question is the subject of intensive research on human behaviour in design employing methods including cognitive and psychometric evaluations and ethno methodological observations. Language-based communication has been argued to play a principal role although the structuring of communication as scaffolds for knowledge construction has never been measured directly. This article puts forth a method for studying design team communication that enables the direct measurement of knowledge construction. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) of language-based communication such as design documentation corpora and verbal communication reveals, from the local co-occurrence of vocabulary, coherence of thought and the formation of a socially held representation of the designed artefact. The results lead to the hypothesis that the similarity of language use bridges indirect relations among components of knowledge stored in each designer's mind, leading to a constructed shared mental representation of the designed artefact.

A document analysis method for characterizing design team performance,"The premise of this research is that the engineering design process is partially driven by achieving consensus anti reconciling points of view among team members. Characterizing the quality of the design performance by measuring the coherence of the description of related design concepts and events in design documentation is examined. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was used to analyze design documentation written by self-managing, cross-functional engineering design teams. Computational measurements of document variance and textual coherence were applied to the teams' design documents, presentation materials and e-mail communication. The levels of semantic coherence were correlated to assessments by faculty and product designers and engineers from industry of the design teams' process and outcome quality. The results indicated a statistically signficant positive correlation between design document coherence and design performance, especially for poorly performing teams. The impact of this research is to provide team managers (people who create teams and manage teams) or self-organizing teams (teams that focus on self-reflection and peer evaluation) computational tools that could be integrated with design information management technologies to assist them in the management of engineering design teams.",2004,"Dong, A; Hill, AW; Agogino, AM",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; PERSONALITY
A linguistic approach to assess the dynamics of design team preference in concept selection,"This paper addresses the problem of describing the decision-making process of a committee of engineers based upon their verbalized linguistic appraisals of alternatives. First, we show a way to model an individual's evaluation of an alternative through natural language based on the Systemic-Functional Linguistics system of APPRAISAL. The linguistic model accounts for both the degree of intensity and the uncertainty of expressed evaluations. Second, this multi-dimensional linguistic model is converted into a scalar to represent the degree of intensity and a probability distribution function for the stated evaluation. Finally, we present a Markovian model to calculate the time-varying change in preferential probability, the probability that an alternative is the most preferred alternative. We further demonstrate how preferential probability toward attributes of alternatives correspond to preferential probability toward alternatives. We illustrate the method on two case studies to highlight the time-variant dynamics of preferences toward alternatives and attributes.

A fuzzy mapping method for Kansei needs interpretation considering the individual Kansei variance,"Having an accurate understanding of the individual's Kansei needs and afterwards designing products that match these needs are particularly important in the era of mass personalisation. Although customers' Kansei needs have been addressed by Kansei engineering, difficulties remain in handling the differences of individual Kansei. In this paper, individual Kansei variance is considered to transform the Kansei words into multisensory design elements, to help designers better understand the individual's Kansei needs. First, a fuzzy cognitive model is proposed to identify the individual Kansei differences in Kansei words by taking customers' characteristics and purchasing motives into consideration. Second, a fuzzy cognitive model-based mapping method is proposed to interpret Kansei words into multisensory design elements. The method incorporates a fuzzy clustering method and basic-emotion systems to identify Kansei variance and to determine design elements' membership of Kansei words dynamically. Finally, the prototype application of the proposed method on a compact SUV is illustrated. The results suggest that individual differences in Kansei terms do exist among customers in the same market segment, and the proposed method has good feasibility and practicability in handling individual Kansei differences in emotional design. Those Kansei dimensions that are more prominent in individual Kansei variance are highly recommended for further digging, which would benefit carrying out personalised customisation and differentiated design.",2021,"Dong, YF; Zhu, RZ; Peng, W; Tian, QH; Guo, G; Liu, WR",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Kansei needs interpretation; Fuzzy cognitive; Motives; Kansei engineering; Fuzzy mapping; 
An ontology approach to support FMEA studies,"FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) is a method to analyze potential reliability problems in the development cycle of the project, making it easier to take actions to overcome such issues, thus enhancing the reliability through design. FMEA is used to identify actions to mitigate the analyzed potential failure modes and their effect on the operations. Anticipating these failure modes, being the central step in the analysis. needs to be carried on extensively, in order to prepare a list of maximum potential failure modes. However, the information stored in risk assessment tools is in the form of textual natural language descriptions that limit computer-based extraction of knowledge for the reuse of the FMEA analyses in other designs or during plant operation. To overcome the limitations of text-based descriptions, FMEA ontology has been proposed that provides a basic set of standard concepts and terms. The development of the ontology uses an upper ontology based on ISO-15926, which defines general-purpose terms and act as a foundation for more specific domains. The ontology is developed so that engineers can build new concepts from the basic set of concepts, This paper evaluates the proposed ontology by means of use cases that measure the performance in finding relevant information used and produced during the safety analyses. In particular, the extraction of knowledge is performed using JTP (an object oriented Modular Reasoning System) that is used for querying the ontology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Extracting Customer Perceptions of Product Sustainability From Online Reviews,"In order for a sustainable product to be successful in the market, designers must create products that are not only sustainable in reality but are also sustainable as perceived by the customer-and reality versus perception of sustainability can be quite different. This paper details a design method to identify perceptions of sustainable features (PerSFs) by collecting online reviews, manually annotating them using crowdsourced work, and processing the annotated review fragments with a natural language machine learning algorithm. We analyze all three pillars of sustainability-social, environmental, and economic-for positive and negative perceptions of product features of a French press coffee carafe. For social aspects, the results show that positive PerSFs are associated with intangible features, such as giving the product as a gift, while negative PerSFs are associated with tangible features perceived as unsafe, like sharp corners. For environmental aspects, positive PerSFs are associated with reliable materials like metal while negative PerSFs are associated with the use of plastic. For economic aspects, PerSFs mainly serve as a price constraint for designers to satisfy other customer perceptions. We also show that some crucial sustainability concerns related to environmental aspects, like energy and water consumption, did not have a significant impact on customer sentiment, thus demonstrating the anticipated gap in sustainability perceptions and the realities of sustainable design, as noted in previous literature. From these results, online reviews can enable designers to extract PerSFs for further design study and to create products that resonate with customers' sustainable values.",2019,"El Dehaibi, N; Goodman, ND; MacDonald, EF",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,design automation; sustainable design; customer perceptions; online reviews; RISK
Automatic extraction of function-behaviour-state information from patents,"Patents contain a large quantity of technical information not available elsewhere and therefore very interesting for both academia and industry. The purpose of the research is to try to detect and extract information about the functions, the physical behaviours and the states of the system directly from the text of a patent in an automatic way.

CPM2: A core model for product data,"The initial core product model (CPM), developed at NIST for the support of in-house research projects, has been extended to create CPM2, intended to support a broad range of information relevant to product lifecycle management. CPM2 is a generic, abstract model with generic semantics. CPM2 gives equal status to three aspects of a product or artifact: its function, its form, and its behavior Thus, CPM2 can support functional reasoning about a product in the conceptual stages of design, the recording and the modeling of its behavior in the postdesign stages as well as the traditional design phases. Three levels of CPM2 models, denoted as the conceptual, intermediate, and implementation models, are described. Extensions of the initial CPM are briefly presented. The facilities in CPM2 for building experimental intermediate systems are demonstrated and a short illustrative example is given. The full practical evaluation of CPM2 will require the development and use of implementation models.",2008,"Fenves, SJ; Foufou, S; Bock, C; Sriram, RD",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,product data representation; function; form; behavior; UML; INFORMATION
Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommending Design Methods,"Every year design practitioners and researchers develop new methods for understanding users and solving problems. This increasingly large collection of methods causes a problem for novice designers: How does one choose which design methods to use for a given problem? Experienced designers can provide case studies that document which methods they used, but studying these cases to infer appropriate methods for a novel problem is inefficient. This research addresses that issue by applying techniques from content-based and collaborative filtering to automatically recommend design methods, given a particular problem. Specifically, we demonstrate the quality with which different algorithms recommend 39 design methods out of an 800+ case study dataset. We find that knowing which methods occur frequently together allows one to recommend design methods more effectively than just using the text of the problem description itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that automatically grouping frequently co-occurring methods using spectral clustering replicates human-provided groupings to 92% accuracy. By leveraging existing case studies, recommendation algorithms can help novice designers efficiently navigate the increasing array of design methods, leading to more effective product design.",2014,"Fuge, M; Peters, B; Agogino, A",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; INFORMATION
Conceptual modeling from natural language functional specifications,"In this paper we describe a structured method for developing a conceptual data model by starting from a functional model expressed in a natural language. We have used the Conceptual Dependency theory for mapping natural language descriptions to conceptual dependency diagrams. We have developed algorithms to convert these conceptual dependency diagrams into unit conceptual dependency tables, which are then merged to represent the whole context of the application. We also show how transactional requirements can be incorporated into the unit conceptual dependency table, and subsequently convert the unit conceptual dependency table into a corresponding conceptual model. We have developed an augmented transition network (ATN) parser to develop conceptual dependency diagrams from natural language descriptions. A prototype system has been implemented using Oracle8i and developer platforms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

From data to knowledge mining,"Most past approaches to data mining have been based on association rules. However, the simple application of association rules usually only changes the user's problem from dealing with millions of data points to dealing with thousands of rules Although this may somewhat reduce the scale of the problem, it is not a completely satisfactory solution. This paper presents interest in exploring certain data sets to extract knowledge, in the form of semantic nets, from large data sets. The KC method has been successfully applied to mine causal relations from oil platform accident reports. In a comparison with association rule techniques for the same domain, KC has shown a significant improvement in the extraction of relevant knowledge, using processing complexity and knowledge manageability as the evaluation criteria.",2009,"Garcia, ACB; Ferraz, I; Vivacqua, AS",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Data Mining; Knowledge Cohesion; Ontology; Sense Making; Text Mining; 
Enhancing user creativity: Semantic measures for idea generation,"Human creativity generates novel ideas to solve real-world problems. This thereby grants us the power to transform the surrounding world and extend our human attributes beyond what is currently possible. Creative ideas are not just new and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are useful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available resources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is poorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of generated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design problem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic measures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic similarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict the success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances information content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative problem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying real-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success of produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem solving, student training and skill acquisition. A selected subset of information content (IC Sanchez-Batet) and semantic similarity (Lin/Sanchez-Batet) measures, which are both statistically powerful and computationally fast, could support the development of technologies for computer-assisted enhancements of human creativity or for the implementation of creativity in machines endowed with general artificial intelligence.

Exploring Automated Text Classification to Improve Keyword Corpus Search Results for Bioinspired Design,"Bioinspired design is the adaptation of methods, strategies, or principles found in nature to solve engineering problems. One formalized approach to bioinspired solution seeking is the abstraction of the engineering problem into a functional need and then seeking solutions to this function using a keyword type search method on text based biological knowledge. These function keyword search approaches have shown potential for success, but as with many text based search methods, they produce a large number of results, many of little relevance to the problem in question. In this paper, we develop a method to train a computer to identify text passages more likely to suggest a solution to a human designer. The work presented examines the possibility of filtering biological keyword search results by using text mining algorithms to automatically identify which results are likely to be useful to a designer. The text mining algorithms are trained on a pair of surveys administered to human subjects to empirically identify a large number of sentences that are, or are not, helpful for idea generation. We develop and evaluate three text classification algorithms, namely, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, a k nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Of these methods, the NB classifier generally had the best performance. Based on the analysis of 60 word stems, a NB classifier's precision is 0.87, recall is 0.52, and F score is 0.65. We find that word stem features that describe a physical action or process are correlated with helpful sentences. Similarly, we find biological jargon feature words are correlated with unhelpful sentences.",2014,"Glier, MW; McAdams, DA; Linsey, JS",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; INFORMATION; ANALOGY
Aspects of language use in design conversation,"This paper investigates some episodes of the conversation between an architect and two clients' representatives in an architectural meeting. The analysis adopts an interpretative approach to design research and is guided by a qualitative research strategy. Designing is conceived as a social, interactive, interpretative process. The aim of the analysis is to reconstruct how participants interactively construct meaning in the design process and to describe practices they employ in the process. Sociological and sociolinguistic concepts and research results are deployed to analyse design conversation and designing in terms of contexts and frames. Analysis shows that participants often construct activities through simultaneous use of different kinds of semiotic practices in different media (such as language, gesture, and drawings) which mutually elaborate each other. Natural language is pervasively used in the observed design conversation. The inherent vagueness of natural language appears to serve several functions in designing such as introducing 'interpretative flexibility' (e. g. of requirements) and establishing social bond. The episodes investigated in this paper provide an example of how the problem 'requirements' emerge in the course of social interaction and of how clients' perspectives are interpreted or translated into design considerations.",2009,"Glock, F",CODESIGN-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COCREATION IN DESIGN AND THE ARTS,interpretative design research; design conversation; context; frame; vagueness; 
Systematic community of Practice activities evaluation through Natural Language Processing: application to research projects,"Community of Practice (CoP) efficiency evaluation is a great deal in research. Indeed, having the possibility to know if a given CoP is successful or not is essential to better manage it over time. The existing approaches for efficiency evaluation are difficult and time-consuming to put into action on real CoPs. They require either to evaluate subjective constructs making the analysis unreliable, either to work out a knowledge interaction matrix that is difficult to set up. However, these approaches build their evaluation on the fact that a CoP is successful if knowledge is exchanged between the members. It is the case if there are some interactions between the actors involved in the CoP. Therefore, we propose to analyze these interactions through the exchanges of emails thanks to Natural Language Processing. Our approach is systematic and semi-automated. It requires the e-mails exchanged and the definition of the speech-acts that will be retrieved. We apply it on a real project-based CoP: the SEPOLBE research project that involves different expertise fields. It allows us to identify the CoP core group and to emphasize learning processes between members with different backgrounds (Microbiology, Electrochemistry and Civil engineering).",2019,"Goepp, V; Matta, N; Caillaud, E; Feugeas, F",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Community of practice; Natural Language Processing; performance evaluation; pragmatics; research project; 
But Is It Creative? Delineating the Impact of Expertise and Concept Ratings on Creative Concept Selection,"While creativity is often stressed in the conceptual phases of design, it is rarely considered during the concept selection process. Before effective methods can be developed to aid in creative concept section, however, differences in the perceptions of creativity between expert and novice designers and the influence of creativity evaluation methods on the process must be considered. Therefore, this paper was developed to address these questions by studying 11 expert and 11 novice designers. Specifically the study was developed to understand if experts' and novices' perception of a concepts creativity aligned, to introduce and compare the utility of our tool for assessing semantic creativity (TASC) to existing creativity evaluation methods, and to identify if our TASC method could be used as a proxy for expert evaluators. Our findings reveal that experts and novices generally had similar perceptions of a concept's creativity and that the TASC method was tapping into similar constructs of human perceptions of concept creativity. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the factors that influence the selection or filtering of creative ideas after idea generation and provide a framework for research in this field.",2016,"Gosnell, CA; Miller, SR",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,conceptual design; design evaluation; design theory and methodology; product design; IDEA GENERATION; SYSTEMATIC-APPROACH; DESIGN; VALIDATION; KNOWLEDGE; NOVELTY; QUALITY; UTILITY; RATERS; MODEL
Adaptive Inspirational Design Stimuli: Using Design Output to Computationally Search for Stimuli That Impact Concept Generation,"Design activity can be supported using inspirational stimuli (e.g., analogies, patents) by helping designers overcome impasses or in generating solutions with more positive characteristics during ideation. Design researchers typically generate inspirational stimuli a priori in order to investigate their impact. However, for a chosen stimulus to possess maximal utility, it should automatically reflect the current and ongoing progress of the designer. In this work, designers receive computationally selected inspirational stimuli midway through an ideation session in response to the contents of their current solution. Sourced from a broad database of related example solutions, the semantic similarity between the content of the current design and concepts within the database determines which potential stimulus is received. Designers receive a particular stimulus based on three experimental conditions: a semantically near stimulus, a semantically far stimulus, or no stimulus (control). Results indicate that adaptive inspirational stimuli can be determined using latent semantic analysis (LSA) and that semantic similarity measures are a promising approach for real-time monitoring of the design process. The ability to achieve differentiable near versus far stimuli was validated using both semantic cosine similarity values and participant self-response ratings. As a further contribution, this work also explores the impact of different types of adaptive inspirational stimuli on design outcomes using a newly introduced design innovation measure. The design innovation measure mathematically captures the overall goodness of a design concept by uniquely combining expert ratings across easier to evaluate subdimensions of feasibility, usefulness, and novelty. While results demonstrate that near inspirational stimuli increase the feasibility of design solutions, they also show the significant impact of the overall inspirational stimulus innovativeness on final design outcomes. In fact, participants are more likely to generate innovative final design solutions when given innovative inspirational stimuli, regardless of their experimental condition.",2020,"Goucher-Lambert, K; Gyory, JT; Kotovsky, K; Cagan, J",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,conceptual design; creativity and concept generation; design theory and methodology; IDEA GENERATION; SIMILARITY
Crowdsourcing inspiration: Using crowd generated inspirational stimuli to support designer ideation,"Inspirational stimuli, such as analogies, are a prominent mechanism used to support designers. However, generating relevant inspirational stimuli remains challenging. This work explores the potential of using an untrained crowd workforce to generate stimuli for trained designers. Crowd workers developed solutions for twelve open-ended design problems from the literature. Solutions were text-mined to extract words along a frequency domain, which, along with computationally derived semantic distances, partitioned stimuli into closer or further distance categories for each problem. The utility of these stimuli was tested in a human subjects experiment (N = 96). Results indicate crowdsourcing holds potential to gather impactful inspirational stimuli for open-ended design problems. Near stimuli improve the feasibility and usefulness of designs solutions, while distant stimuli improved their uniqueness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Social media-based opinion retrieval for product analysis using multi-task deep neural networks,"Social media platforms are considered one of the most effective intermediaries for companies to interact with consumers. Social media-based decision support systems for the marketing domain are highly developed, but product development and innovation-oriented studies remain limited. This study offers a novel approach which utilises opinion retrieval theme along with sentiment analysis to support the decision-making process for product analysis and development. To achieve this aim, we propose an end-to-end social media-based opinion retrieval system and utilise machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Google Glass is chosen as a usecase as this product was unable to achieve its commercial targets despite its superior technological offerings. We design a multi-task deep neural network architecture for the training of sentiment prediction and opinion detection tasks. We first divide the tweets containing certain useful opinions and suggestions into two categories based on their sentiment labels. The negative tweets are analysed to identify product-related concerns, whereas the positive and neutral tweets are used to extract innovative ideas and identify new use cases for product development. We visualise and interpret the clusters of keywords extracted from each sentiment label group.

Ontology based semantic conflicts resolution in collaborative editing of design documents,"Semantic conflicts happen frequently during collaborative editing of design documents. The problem of semantic consistency of words and the maintenance of users' editing intentions are the two major challenges when resolving those semantic conflicts. Based on WordNet this paper presents an ontology description language-FLoDL and introduces it to describe the global ontology library (GOL) and the individual ontology library (IOL) in collaborative editing. By this means, we reconstruct the architecture of collaborative editing and propose a mixed peer-to-peer structured semantic collaborative editing architecture. Then a new algorithm for inserting operations, from which semantic conflicts are often caused, is designed to solve the problem of semantic consistency of words. Moreover, by adding users' individualized semantic information into their IOL, we provide the users with individualized services and successfully maintain users' editing intensions. Finally, through some detailed experiments, we perform a compared analysis to show that semantic collaborative editing not only keeps smaller clients (less storage space) but also localizes many editing operations and thereby improves the performance of collaborative editing.

Kansei evaluation for group of users: A data-driven approach using dominance-based rough sets,"Kansei refers to people's subjective feeling and impression. Kansei evaluation devotes to assessing users' preferences for product items according to multiple Kansei attributes, thus supporting the decision making of consumers and/or designers. The objective of this paper is to propose a data-driven approach for addressing user group oriented Kansei evaluation. The approach consists of three phases. The first phase identifies the representative Kansei attributes and product samples of the product domain to gather exemplary evaluation dataset from sampled representative users. In light of the specified Kansei need and relying on the dominance-based rough set approach, the second phase constructs the collective decision table so as to further infer the collective preferential information in terms of dominance-based decision rules and Kansei importance weights. The third phase presents a two-step sequential heuristic model for characterizing users' affective preference behavior: (1) a multicriteria classifier using dominance-based decision rules for product sorting, partly simulating the satisficing heuristic; and (2) a simple choice strategy for product ranking, manifesting the CONF heuristic. A case study involving the toaster domain was conducted to verify the proposed approach. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed approach are also discussed.",2021,"Guo, Fu; Hu, Mingcai; Duffy, Vincent G.; Shao, Hao; Ren, Zenggen",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Dominance-based rough set approach; Heuristic decision making; Kansei evaluation; Kansei needs; User group
Research on high creative application of case-based reasoning system on engineering design,"Case-based reasoning (CBR) has shown significant superiority in creative application (innovation) in many areas, especially those strong in practice but poor in theory, such as engineering design. But existing CBR systems have poor semantic understanding, which seriously hampers their creative application. So this paper mainly focuses on the research of case retrieval of CBR system and proposes an intelligent case retrieval method by integrating ontology technology into CBR system. The proposed method has enough semantic understanding ability and can help designers find the desired case, from which designers can gain enlightenment and inspiration for developing new ideas. The work of this research is mainly that adopt the combination of two ontology acquisition means to improve domain knowledge acquisition and propose a new semantic retrieval method to improve semantic understanding of case retrieval. At last a kind of typical engineering design - injection mold design is taken an example to validate the proposed method and Lots of experiments are organized to test the performance and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing models.

The use of analogy and ontology in design activities to support design creativity have previously been explored. This paper explores an approach to construct ontologies with sufficient richness and coverage to support reasoning over real-world datasets for prompting creative idea generation. This approach has been implemented into a computational tool for assisting designers in generating creative ideas during the early stages of design. The tool, called the Retriever, has been developed based on ontology by embracing the aspects of analogical reasoning. A case study has indicated that the tool can be effective and useful for idea generation.

Analysis of sentiment expressions for user-centered design,"Devising intelligent systems capable of identifying the idiosyncratic needs of users at scale and translating them into attribute-level design feedback and recommendations is a key prerequisite for successful user-centered design processes. Recent studies show that 49% of design firms lack systems and tools for monitoring external platforms, and only 8% have adopted digital, data-driven approaches for new product development despite acknowledging them as a high priority. The state-of-the-art attribute-level sentiment analysis approaches based on deep learning have achieved promising results; however, these methods pose strict preconditions, require manually labeled data for training and pre-defined attributes by experts, and only classify sentiments intro predefined categories which have limited implications for designers. This article develops a rule-based methodology for extracting and analyzing the sentiment expressions of users on a large scale, from myriad reviews available on social media and e-commerce platforms. The methodology further advances current unsupervised attribute-level sentiment analysis approaches by enabling efficient identification and mapping of sentiment expressions of individual users onto their respective attributes.

Eliciting Attribute-Level User Needs From Online Reviews With Deep Language Models and Information Extraction,"Eliciting user needs for individual components and features of a product or a service on a large scale is a key requirement for innovative design. Synthesizing data as an initial discovery phase of a design process is usually accomplished with a small number of participants, employing qualitative research methods such as observations, focus groups, and interviews. This leaves an entire swath of pertinent user behavior, preferences, and opinions not captured. Sentiment analysis is a key enabler for large-scale need finding from online user reviews generated on a regular basis. A major limitation of current sentiment analysis approaches used in design sciences, however, is the need for laborious labeling and annotation of large review datasets for training, which in turn hinders their scalability and transferability across different domains. This article proposes an efficient and scalable methodology for automated and large-scale elicitation of attribute-level user needs. The methodology builds on the state-of-the-art pretrained deep language model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), with new convolutional net and named entity recognition (NER) layers for extracting attribute, description, and sentiment words from online user review corpora. The machine translation algorithm BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) is utilized to extract need expressions in the form of predefined part-of-speech combinations (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-noun).

A function-based computational method for design concept evaluation,"Concept generation is an indispensable step of innovation design. However, the limited knowledge and design thinking fixation of designers often impede the generation of novel design concepts. Computational tools can be a necessary supplement for designers. They can generate a big number of design concepts based on an existing knowledge base. For filtering these design concepts, this work presents a computational measurement of novelty, feasibility and diversity based on 500,000 granted patents. First, about 1700 functional terms (terminologies) are mapped to high dimensional vectors (100 dimensional space) by word embedding technique. The resulted database is knowledge base-I (KB-I). Then, we adopt circular convolution to convert patents into high dimensional vectors. The resulted database is KB-II. Based on the two knowledge bases, the computational definitions of novelty, feasibility and diversity are developed. We conduct six experiments based on KB-II, a random dataset and a real product dataset, and the results show that these metrics can be used to roughly filter a big number of design concepts, and then expert-based method can be further used. This work provides a computational framework for measuring the novelty, feasibility and diversity of design concept. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Mining and Representing the Concept Space of Existing Ideas for Directed Ideation,"Design innovation projects often generate large numbers of design ideas from designers, users, and, increasingly, the crowd over the Internet. Such idea data are often used for selection and implementation but, in fact, can 1also be used as sources of inspiration for further idea generation. In particular, the elementary concepts that underlie the original ideas can be recombined to generate new ideas. But it is not a trivial task to retrieve concepts from raw lists of ideas and data sources in a manner that can stimulate or generate new ideas. A significant difficulty lies in the fact that idea data are often expressed in unstructured natural languages. This paper develops a methodology that uses natural language processing to extract key words as elementary concepts embedded in massive idea descriptions and represents the elementary concept space in a core-periphery structure to direct the recombination of elementary concepts into new ideas. We apply the methodology to mine and represent the concept space underlying massive crowdsourced ideas and use it to generate new ideas for future transportation system designs in a real public sector-sponsored project via humans and automated computer programs.

Ontology based knowledge extraction for shipyard fabrication workshop reports,"In this paper, a method to extract knowledge from a set of surveyors' reports is proposed. Many surveyors from shipping companies are working in shipyards to improve the quality and to meet requirements of the ship owner. At present, the reports from surveyors are used only for managing the status of problems of the product. The proposed method here has three steps. First, the description field of the reports which contains information about some trouble is summarized in a pair of a component name and a trouble name in the failure database; this is made possible through text-processing technology. Second, synonymous component and trouble names are consolidated into normalized terms using synonym ontology to prepare this information for statistical analysis. The synonym ontology is developed prior to this procedure. The system evaluates frequent trouble records by classifying the records using component and process ontology. In the last step, the designers extract knowledge from the information generated by the system. The results illustrate common design problems, and the method is proved to be useful.

Mining Changes in User Expectation Over Time From Online Reviews,"Customers post online reviews at any time. With the timestamp of online reviews, they can be regarded as a flow of information. With this characteristic, designers can capture the changes in customer feedback to help set up product improvement strategies. Here, we propose an approach for capturing changes in user expectation on product affordances based on the online reviews for two generations of products. First, the approach uses a rule-based natural language processing method to automatically identify and structure product affordances from review text. Then, inspired by the Kano model which classifies preferences of product attributes in five categories, conjoint analysis is used to quantitatively categorize the structured affordances. Finally, changes in user expectation can be found by applying the conjoint analysis on the online reviews posted for two successive generations of products. A case study based on the online reviews of Kindle e-readers downloaded from amazon. com shows that designers can use our proposed approach to evaluate their product improvement strategies for previous products and develop new product improvement strategies for future products.",2019,"Hou, TJ; Yannou, B; Leroy, Y; Poirson, E",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; DESIGN; AFFORDANCES
Discovering taxonomic structure in design archives with application to risk-mitigating actions in a large engineering organisation,"This paper demonstrates a general iterative technique for discovering a taxonomy that categorises information contained within a weakly structured design project archive. It is common for large engineering organisations to maintain archives about past design projects. In principle, engineering organisations could mine these archives to extract useful lessons and relationships that would improve future design projects. However, this is difficult in practice, since archives often consist of weakly structured data formats, such as plaintext documentation. This restricts the use of many useful analysis tools. The taxonomy-discovery process presented here is a critical first step towards unlocking the value of such archives. The technique is based on methods from the qualitative research literature. We demonstrate this process by creating a taxonomy of risk-mitigating actions in design projects based on a design project archive from a large engineering organisation. We discuss practical considerations such as missing contextual information as part of the case study. The taxonomy is sufficiently generic to be of use to other organisations. Furthermore, individual organisations can use the iterative technique introduced in this paper to tailor the taxonomy to their own project archives. Thus, this research provides an important foundation for unlocking the value of archived design project information.",2016,"Hsiao, C; Ruffino, M; Malak, R; Tumer, IY; Doolen, T",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,taxonomies; Design information management; risk analysis and management; knowledge representation; INFORMATION; ONTOLOGIES; AGREEMENT; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT
Enabling the development of base domain ontology through extraction of knowledge from engineering domain handbooks,"Domain ontology, encompassing both concepts and instances, along with their relations and properties, is a new medium for the storage and propagation of domain specific knowledge. A significant problem remains the effort which must be expended during ontology construction. This involves collecting the domain-related vocabularies, developing the domain concept hierarchy, and defining the properties of each concept and the relationships between concepts. Recently several engineering handbooks have described detailed domain knowledge by organizing the knowledge into categories, sections, and chapters with indices in the appendix. This paper proposes the extraction of concepts, instances, and relationships from a handbook of a specific domain to quickly construct base domain ontology as a good starting point for expediting the development process of more comprehensive domain ontology. The extracted information can also be reorganized and converted into web ontology language format to represent the base domain ontology. The generation of a base domain ontology from an Earthquake Engineering Handbook is used to illustrate the proposed approach. In addition, quality evaluation of the extracted base ontology is performed and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A collaborative desktop tagging system for group knowledge management based on concept space,"The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier.

Constructing and measuring domain-specific emotions for affective design: a descriptive approach to deal with individual differences,"Assessing design solutions via domain-specific emotions has been widely concerned and explored in the field of affective design. However, the examination and accommodation of individual differences have not been settled sufficiently in the literature. To address this research gap, this paper proposes a descriptive approach to draw calibrated collective emotion patterns in survey-based affective design assessment. A `Repertory Grid Interview linked with Rate-All-That-Apply' (RGI/RATA) procedure is firstly conducted to elicit and code the individual's personal emotional descriptions into mid-level Emotion Words (EWs) and to gather emotion data grids with each grid quantified by an individual's own EWs. The obtained individualised emotion data grids are then subjected to Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to extract collective emotional space, thus to enable conceptualising collective emotional dimensions and measuring calibrated collective responses. A case study demonstrating the implementation process for a simple project of appearance design assessment is also presented. Practitioner Summary: The proposed methodology may help a design team to investigate the shared patterns of domain-specific emotions through a single assessment survey. With the provided post hoc analysis tools, designers may also evaluate multi-level individual differences (e.g. regarding user groups or even intra-individual) quantitatively and at a low cost.",2020,"Hu, Mingcai; Guo, Fu; Duffy, Vincent G.; Ren, Zenggen; Yue, Peng",ERGONOMICS,affective design; individual differences; Domain-specific emotions; multiple factor analysis; repertory grid interview
CACDA: A knowledge graph for a context-aware cognitive design assistant,"The design of complex engineered systems highly relies on a laborious zigzagging between computeraided design (CAD) software and design rules prescribed by design manuals. Despite the emergence of knowledge management techniques (ontology, expert system, text mining, etc.), companies continue to store design rules in large and unstructured documents. To facilitate the integration of design rules and CAD software, we propose a knowledge graph that structures a large set of design rules in a computable format. The knowledge graph organises entities of design rules (nodes), relationships among design rules (edges), as well as contextual information. The categorisation of entities and relationships in four subcontexts: semantic, social, engineering, and IT - facilitates the development of the data model, especially the definition of the “design context” concept. The knowledge graph paves the way to a context-aware cognitive design assistant. Indeed, connected to or embedded in a CAD software, a context-aware cognitive design assistant will capture the design context in near real time and run reasoning operations on the knowledge graph to extend traditional CAD capabilities, such as the recommendation of design rules, the verification of design solutions, or the automation of design routines. Our validation experiment shows that the current version of the context-aware cognitive design assistant is more efficient than the traditional document-based design. On average, participants using an unstructured design rules document have a precision of 0.36 whereas participants using our demonstrator obtain a 0.61 precision score. Finally, designers supported by the design assistant spend more time designing than searching for applicable design rules compared to the traditional design approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TechWord: Development of a technology lexical database for structuring textual technology information based on natural language processing,"The role of text mining based on technological documents such as patents is important in the research field of technology intelligence for technology R&D planning. In addition, WordNet, an English-based lexical database, is widely used for pre-processing text data such as word lemmatization and synonym search. However, technological vocabulary information is complex and specific, and WordNet's ability to analyze technological information is limited in its reflecting technological features. Thus, to improve the text mining performance of technological information, this study proposes a methodology for designing a TechWord-based lexical database that is based on the lexical characteristics of technological words that are differentiated from general words. To do this, we define TechWord, a technology lexical information, and construct a TechSynset, a synonym set between TechWords. First, through dependency parsing between words, TechWord, a unit word that describes a technology, is structured and identifies nouns and verbs. The importance of connectivity is investigated by a network centrality index analysis based on the dependency relations of words. Subsequently, to search for synonyms suitable for the target technology domain, a TechSynset is constructed through synset information, with an additional analysis that calculates cosine similarity based on a word embedding vector. Applying the proposed methodology to the actual technology-related information analysis, we collect patent data on the technological fields of the automotive field, and present the results of the TechWord and TechSynset. This study improves technological information-based text mining by structuring the word-to-word link information in technological documents based on an automated process.",2021,"Jang, Hyejin; Jeong, Yujin; Yoon, Byungun",EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Natural language processing; WordNet; Patent mining; Text mining; Lexical analysis
Automatic CAD model retrieval based on design documents using semantic processing and rule processing,"Reuse of CAD model is important for manufacturing companies where similar products are produced. If existing CAD models have design information related to the design of a new product, their reuse saves costs and reduces time of product design. Since design documents generated in the early design stage contain product specifications and design directions for new product design, they can be used as input queries to retrieve existing CAD models. In this paper, we propose an approach to retrieving CAD models with design documents. A major challenge of the proposed approach was reduction of semantic gap between design documents and CAD models because design documents generated in the early design stage contain abstract design descriptions, while CAD models contain detailed design descriptions. In order to reduce the semantic gap between CAD models and design documents, we adopt semantic processing and rule processing. During the semantic processing, semantic representations are generated from the text in CAD models and text in design documents using a domain ontology and shallow natural language processing (NLP). Hidden design information is extracted from CAD models and design documents based on rule processing. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the keyword-based approach which does not overcome semantic gap.

An approach to the extraction of preference-related information from design team language,"The process of selecting among design alternatives is an important activity in the early stages of design. A designer is said to express design preferences when assigning priorities to a set of possible design choices. However, the assignment of preferences becomes more challenging on both a practical and theoretical level when performed by a group. This paper presents a probabilistic approach for estimating a team's overall preference-related information known as preferential probabilities that extracts information from the natural language used in team discussion transcripts without aggregation of individual team member opinions. Assessment of the method is conducted by surveying a design team to obtain quantitative ratings of alternatives. Two different approaches are applied to convert these ratings into values that may be compared to the results of transcript analysis: the application of a modified Logit model and simulation based on the principle of maximum entropy. The probabilistic approach proposed in the paper represents how likely a choice is to be “most preferred” by a design team over a given period of time. A preliminary design selection experiment was conducted as an illustrative case example of the method. Correlations were found between the preferential probabilities estimated from transcripts and those computed from the surveyed preferences. The proposed methods may provide a formal way to understand and represent informal, unstructured design information using a low overhead information extraction method.",2012,"Ji, Haifeng; Yang, Maria C.; Honda, Tomonori",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Concept selection; Design decision-making; Design preferences; Design process
A multi-objective PSO approach of mining association rules for affective design based on online customer reviews,"Affective design is an important aspect of new product development that can enhance customer satisfaction of new products. Previous studies generally conducted customer surveys based on questionnaires and interviews to collect customers' views and preferences of affective design of products. However, the process could be time-consuming and the survey data does not contain much sentiment expression. Presently, a large number of online customer reviews on products can be found on various websites that contain rich information of customer opinions and expectations. However, the generation of useful information based on online customer reviews for affective design has not been addressed in previous studies. In this paper, a methodology for generating association rules for supporting affective design based on online customer reviews is proposed which mainly involves opinion mining of affective dimensions from online customer reviews and association rule mining based on multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Opinion mining is adopted to analyze online reviews and conduct sentiment analysis for affective dimensions. Based on the mined information and morphological analysis of products, a multi-objective PSO approach is proposed to generate association rules that depict the relationships between affective dimensions and design attributes. A case study was conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology.",2018,"Jiang, HM; Kwong, CK; Park, WY; Yu, KM",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Affective design; opinion mining; association rule mining; multi-objective PSO; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PRODUCT DESIGN; ROUGH SET; REGRESSION APPROACH; NEURAL-NETWORK; FORM DESIGN; SATISFACTION; FEATURES; SYSTEM; EXTRACTION
Predicting Future Importance of Product Features Based on Online Customer Reviews,"Previous studies conducted customer surveys based on questionnaires and interviews, and the survey data were then utilized to analyze product features. In recent years, online customer reviews on products became extremely popular, which contain rich information on customer opinions and expectations. However, previous studies failed to properly address the determination of the importance of product features and prediction of their future importance based on online reviews. Accordingly, a methodology for predicting future importance weights of product features based on online customer reviews is proposed in this paper which mainly involves opinion mining, a fuzzy inference method, and a fuzzy time series method. Opinion mining is adopted to analyze the online reviews and extract product features. A fuzzy inference method is used to determine the importance weights of product features using both frequencies and sentiment scores obtained from opinion mining. A fuzzy time series method is adopted to predict the future importance of product features. A case study on electric irons was conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology. To evaluate the effectiveness of the fuzzy time series method in predicting the future importance, the results obtained by the fuzzy time series method are compared with those obtained by the three common forecasting methods. The results of the comparison show that the prediction results based on fuzzy time series method are better than those based on exponential smoothing, simple moving average, and fuzzy moving average methods.",2017,"Jiang, HM; Kwong, CK; Yung, KL",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,product features; opinion mining; fuzzy inference method; fuzzy time series method; new product development; ENGINEERING CHARACTERISTICS; REQUIREMENTS; OPINIONS; SYSTEM
Dynamic modelling of customer preferences for product design using DENFIS and opinion mining,"Previous studies mainly employed customer surveys to collect survey data for understanding customer preferences on products and developing customer preference models. In reality, customer preferences on products could change over time. Thus, the time series data of customer preferences under different time periods should be collected for the modelling of customer preferences. However, it is difficult to obtain the time series data based on customer surveys because of long survey time and substantial resources involved. In recent years, a large number of online customer reviews of products can be found on various websites, from which the time series data of customer preferences can be extracted easily. Some previous studies have attempted to analyse customer preferences on products based on online customer reviews. However, two issues were not addressed in previous studies which are the fuzziness of the sentiment expressed by customers existing in online reviews and the modelling of customer preferences based on the time series data obtained from online reviews. In this paper, a new methodology for dynamic modelling of customer preferences based on online customer reviews is proposed to address the two issues which mainly involves opinion mining and dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS). Opinion mining is adopted to analyze online reviews and perform sentiment analysis on the reviews under different time periods. With the mined time series data and the product attribute settings of reviewed products, a DENFIS approach is introduced to perform the dynamic modelling of customer preferences. A case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The results of validation tests indicate that the proposed DENFIS approach outperforms various adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches in the dynamic modelling of customer preferences in terms of the mean relative error and variance of errors. In addition, the proposed DENFIS approach can provide both crisp and fuzzy outputs that cannot be realized by using existing ANFIS and conventional DENFIS approaches.",2019,"Jiang, Huimin; Kwong, C.

Technology-driven roadmaps for identifying new product/market opportunities: Use of text mining and quality function deployment,"A technology roadmap (TRM), an approach that is applied to the development of an emerging technology to meet business goals, is one of the most frequently adopted tools to support the process of technology innovation. Although many studies have dealt with TftMs that are designed primarily for a market-driven technology planning process, a technology-driven TRM is far less researched than a market-driven one. Furthermore, approaches to a technology-driven roadmap using quantitative technological information have rarely been studied. Thus, the aim of this research is to propose a new methodological framework to identify both profitable markets and promising product concepts based on technology information. This study suggests two quality function deployment (QFD) matrices to draw up the TRM in order to find new business opportunities. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed approach using patents on the solar-lighting devices, which is catching on as a high-tech way to prevent environmental pollution and reduce fuel costs.

Prioritising engineering characteristics based on customer online reviews for quality function deployment,"In market-driven product design, customer requirements (CRs) are usually obtained from consumer surveys. However, valuable CRs can also be found in a large number of online reviews. Largely due to their free text nature and the quantity, these reviews are often neglected and are seldom utilised directly by designers. In this work, one important question in quality function deployment on how to prioritise engineering characteristics (ECs) is investigated. Customer opinions concerning ECs are extracted from online reviews. By taking advantage of such opinion information, an ordinal classification approach is proposed to prioritise ECs. In a pairwise manner, in which customer opinions are deemed as features and the overall customer satisfactions are regarded as the target values, the weights of ECs are derived. Furthermore, an integer linear programming model is implemented to convert the pairwise results into the original customer satisfaction ratings. Finally, an exploratory case study is presented using reviews of four branded printers collected from Amazon and their analysis was conducted by two experienced design engineers. The experimental study reveals the merits of the proposed approach.",2014,"Jin, J; Ji, P; Liu, Y",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,QFD; product design; user review analysis; engineering characteristics; customer reviews; PRODUCT REVIEWS; SATISFACTION; REGRESSION; QFD
Review on Recent Advances in Information Mining From Big Consumer Opinion Data for Product Design,"In this paper, based on more than ten years' studies on this dedicated research thrust, a comprehensive review concerning information mining from big consumer opinion data in order to assist product design is presented.

Next, studies concerning information extraction and information utilization of big consumer opinion data for product design are reviewed. Studies on information extraction of big consumer opinion data are explained from various perspectives, including data acquisition, opinion target recognition, feature identification and sentiment analysis, opinion summarization and sampling, etc. Reviews on information utilization of big consumer opinion data for product design are explored in terms of how to extract critical customer needs from big consumer opinion data, how to connect the voice of the customers with product design, how to make effective comparisons and reasonable ranking on similar products, how to identify ever-evolving customer concerns efficiently, and so on. Furthermore, significant and practical aspects of research trends are highlighted for future studies. This survey will facilitate researchers and practitioners to understand the latest development of relevant studies and applications centered on how big consumer opinion data can be processed, analyzed, and exploited in aiding product design.",2019,"Jin, J; Liu, Y; Ji, P; Kwong, CK",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT; PRIORITIZING ENGINEERING CHARACTERISTICS; ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE CREATION; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; CONCEPT GENERATION; CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS; ONLINE REVIEWS; IDEA GENERATION; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION
Identifying comparative customer requirements from product online reviews for competitor analysis,"A large volume of product online reviews are generated from time to time, which contain rich information regarding customer requirements. These reviews help designers to make exhaustive analyses of competitors, which is one indispensable step in market-driven product design. How to extract critical opinionated sentences associated with some specific features from product online reviews has been investigated by some researchers. However, few of them examined how to employ these valuable resources for competitor analysis. Hence, in this research, a framework is illustrated to select pairs of opinionated representative yet comparative sentences with specific product features from reviews of competitive products. With the help of the techniques on sentiment analysis, opinionated sentences referring to a specific feature are first identified from product online reviews. Then, information representativeness, information comparativeness and information diversity are investigated for the selection of a small number of representative yet comparative opinionated sentences. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated, and three greedy algorithms are proposed to analyze this problem for suboptimal solutions. Finally, with a large amount of real data from Amazon.com, categories of extensive experiments are conducted and the final encouraging results are realized, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Translating online customer opinions into engineering characteristics in QFD: A probabilistic language analysis approach,"Online opinions provide informative customer requirements for product designers. However, the increasing volume of opinions make them hard to be digested entirely. It is expected to translate online opinions for designers automatically when they are launching a new product. In this research, an exploratory study is conducted, in which customer requirements in online reviews are manually translated into engineering characteristics (ECs) for Quality function deployment (QFD). From the exploratory study, a simple mapping from keywords to ECs is observed not able to be built. It is also found that it will be a time-consuming task to translate a large number of reviews. Accordingly, a probabilistic language analysis approach is proposed, which translates reviews into ECs automatically. In particular, the statistic concurrence information between keywords and nearby words is analyzed. Based on the unigram model and the bigram model, an integrated impact learning algorithm is advised to estimate the impacts of keywords and nearby words respectively. The estimated impacts are utilized to infer which ECs are implied in a given context. Using four brands of printer reviews from Amazon.com, comparative experiments are conducted. Finally, an illustrative example is shown to clarify how this approach can be applied by designers in QFD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Approach for Importance-Performance Analysis of Product Attributes From Online Reviews,"The importance-performance analysis (IPA) is a widely used technique to guide strategic planning for the improvement of customer satisfaction. Compared with surveys, numerous online reviews can be easily collected at a lower cost. Online reviews provide a promising source for the IPA. This paper proposes an approach for conducting the IPA from online reviews for product design. Product attributes from online reviews are first identified by latent Dirichlet allocation. The performance of the identified attributes is subsequently estimated by the aspect-based sentiment analysis of IBM Watson. Finally, the importance of the identified attributes is estimated by evaluating the effect of sentiments of each product attribute on the overall rating using an explainable deep neural network. A Shapley additive explanation-based method is proposed to estimate the importance values of product attributes with a low variance by combining the effect of the input features from multiple optimal neural networks with a high performance. A case study of smartphones is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. The performance and importance estimates of the proposed approach are compared with those of previous sentiment analysis and neural network-based method, and the results exhibit that the former can perform IPA more reliably. The proposed approach uses minimal manual operation and can support companies to take decisions rapidly and effectively, compared with survey-based methods.",2021,"Joung, Junegak; Kim, Harrison M.",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,data-driven design; neural network; interpretable machine learning
Characterizing innovative processes in design spaces through measuring the information entropy of empirical data from protocol studies,"This paper reports on a study characterizing design processes and the potential of design spaces through measuring the information entropy of empirical data derived from protocol studies. The sequential segments in a protocol analysis can be related to each other by examining their semantic content producing a design session's linkograph, which defines the design space for a design session. From a linkograph, it is possible to compute the probabilities of the connectivity of each segment for its forelinks and its backlinks, together with the probabilities of distance among links. A linkograph's entropy is a measure of the information in the design session. It is claimed that the entropy of the linkograph measures the potential of the design space being generated as the design proceeds chronologically. We present an approach to the automated construction of linkographs by connecting segments using the lexical database WordNet and measure its entropy. A case study of two design sessions with different characteristics was conducted, one considered more productive and creative, the other more pragmatic. Those segments with high entropy and those associated with high rates of change of entropy are analyzed. The creative session has a higher linkograph entropy. This result indicates the potential of using entropy to characterize a design process.",2018,"Kan, JWT; Gero, JS",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Design Processes; Entropy; Information Analysis; Protocol Studies; 
Automated feedback generation for formal manufacturing rule extraction,"Manufacturing knowledge is maintained primarily in the unstructured text in industry. To facilitate the reuse of the knowledge, previous efforts have utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify manufacturing documents or to extract structured knowledge (e.g. ontology) from manufacturing text. On the other hand, extracting more complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rule, has not been feasible in a practical scenario, as standard NLP techniques cannot address the input text that needs validation. Specifically, if the input text contains the information irrelevant to the rule-definition or semantically invalid expression, standard NLP techniques cannot selectively derive precise information for the extraction of the desired formal manufacturing rule. To address the gap, we developed the feedback generation method based on Constraint-based Modeling (CBM) coupled with NLP and domain ontology, designed to support formal manufacturing rule extraction. Specifically, the developed method identifies the necessity of input text validation based on the predefined constraints and provides the relevant feedback to help the user modify the input text, so that the desired rule can be extracted. We proved the feasibility of the method by extending the previously implemented formal rule extraction framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by enabling the extraction of correct manufacturing rules from all the cases that need input text validation, about 30% of the dataset, after modifying the input text based on the feedback. We expect the feedback generation method will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based technology in the manufacturing field, by facilitating precise knowledge acquisition from manufacturing-related documents in a practical scenario.",2019,"Kang, SK; Path, L; Rangarajan, A; Moitra, A; Jia, T; Robinson, D; Dutta, D",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Automated feedback generation; Natural Language Processing; semantic technology; ontology; KNOWLEDGE; METHODOLOGY; RETRIEVAL
Ontology-Based Ambiguity Resolution of Manufacturing Text for Formal Rule Extraction,"Manufacturing companies maintain manufacturing knowledge primarily as unstructured text. To facilitate formal use of such knowledge, previous efforts have utilized natural language processing (NLP) to classify manufacturing documents or extract manufacturing concepts/relations. However, extracting more complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rules, has been evasive due to the lack of methods to resolve ambiguities. Specifically, standard NLP techniques do not address domain-specific ambiguities that are due to manufacturing-specific meanings implicit in the text. To address this important gap, we propose an ambiguity resolution method that utilizes domain ontology as the mechanism to incorporate the domain context. We demonstrate its feasibility by extending our previously implemented manufacturing rule extraction framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by resolving all the domain-specific ambiguities in the dataset and an improvement in correct detection of rules to 70% (increased by about 13%). We expect that this work will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based technology in manufacturing field, by enabling the extraction of precise formal knowledge from text.",2019,"Kang, SK; Patil, L; Rangarajan, A; Moitra, A; Robinson, D; Jia, T; Dutta, D",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; KNOWLEDGE
An automated approach to quantifying functional interactions by mining large-scale product specification data,"The authors of this work hypothesise that the semantic relationship between modules' functional descriptions is correlated with the functional interaction between the modules. A deeper comprehension of the functional interactions between modules enables designers to integrate complex systems during the early stages of the product design process. Existing approaches that measure functional interactions between modules rely on the manual provision of designers' expert analyses, which may be time consuming and costly. The increased quantity and complexity of products in the twenty-first century further exacerbates these challenges. This work proposes an approach to automatically quantify the functional interactions between modules, based on their textual technical descriptions. Compared with manual analyses by design experts who use traditional design structure matrix approaches, the text-mining-driven methodology discovers similar functional interactions, while maintaining comparable accuracies. The case study presented in this work analyses an automotive climate control system and compares the functional interaction solutions achieved by a traditional design team with those achieved following the methodology outlined in this paper.",2016,"Kang, SW; Tucker, C",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Functional interaction; text mining; design structure matrix; DESIGN STRUCTURE MATRIX; FAMILY DESIGN; MODULARITY; MODEL; METHODOLOGY; REVIEWS; SYSTEMS
Using semantic environment description as a tool to evaluate car interiors,"The semantic environment description (SMB) is a structured method used for evaluating the impression of an architectural environment. The SMB-method measures the impression with eight factors: pleasantness, complexity, unity, potency, social status, enclosedness, affection and originality. The SMB-method is also a useful tool for measuring the impression of a vehicle interior since the method is easy to administrate, has high reliability and validity, is easily adaptable for cross cultural comparisons and provides useful knowledge for design, engineering and marketing. The purpose of the present study was to more deeply investigate the feasibility of the SMB method for measuring the impression of vehicle interiors and to compare customers' and Volvo employees' assessments. The present study confirms that the SMB-method is easy to administer. The method is useful, even though it is not optimized for vehicle environments. If complemented with qualitative techniques the SMB-method provides more interesting results. Volvo employees and customers assessed the vehicle interiors slightly different. Thus it is recommended to use customer's assessments to aquire useful results.",2003,"Karlsson, BSA; Aronsson, N; Svensson, KA",ERGONOMICS,car interior design; semantic environment description; semantic scales; SMB
Ontology-based approach for the provision of simulation knowledge acquired by Data and Text Mining processes,"Numerical simulation techniques such as Finite Element Analyses are essential in today's engineering design practices. However, comprehensive knowledge is required for the setup of reliable simulations to verify strength and further product properties. Due to limited capacities, design-accompanying simulations are performed too rarely by experienced simulation engineers. Therefore, product models are not sufficiently verified or the simulations lead to wrong design decisions, if they are applied by less experienced users. This results in belated redesigns of already detailed product models and to highly cost- and time-intensive iterations in product development. Thus, in order to support less experienced simulation users in setting up reliable Finite Element Analyses, a novel ontology-based approach is presented. The knowledge management tools developed on the basis of this approach allow an automated acquisition and target-oriented provision of necessary simulation knowledge. This knowledge is acquired from existing simulation models and text-based documentations from previous product developments by Text and Data Mining. By offering support to less experienced simulation users, the presented approach may finally lead to a more efficient and extensive application of reliable FEA in product development.",2019,"Kestel, Philipp; Kuegler, Patricia; Zirngibl, Christoph; Schleich, Benjamin; Wartzack, Sandro",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Data Mining; Finite Element Analysis; Knowledge-based engineering; Ontology-based knowledge representation; Simulation; Text Mining
Answering engineers' questions using semantic annotations,"Question-answering (QA) systems have proven to be helpful, especially to those who feel uncomfortable entering keywords, sometimes extended with search symbols such as +, *, and so forth. In developing such systems, the main focus has been on the enhanced retrieval performance of searches, and recent trends in QA systems center on the extraction of exact answers. However, when their usability was evaluated, some users indicated that they found it difficult to accept the answers because of the absence of supporting context and rationale. Current approaches to address this problem include providing answers with linking paragraphs or with summarizing extensions. Both methods are believed to be sufficient to answer questions seeking the names of objects or quantities that have only a single answer, However, neither method addresses the situation when an answer requires the comparison and integration of information appearing in multiple documents or in several places in a single document. This paper argues that coherent answer generation is crucial for such questions, and that the key to this coherence is to analyze texts to a level beyond sentence annotations. To demonstrate this idea, a prototype has been developed based on rhetorical structure theory, and a preliminary evaluation has been carried out. The evaluation indicates that users prefer to see the extended answers that can be generated using such semantic annotations, provided that additional context and rationale information are made available.",2007,"Kim, S; Bracewell, RH; Wallace, KM",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,information retrieval; natural language processing; question-answering; rhetorical structure theory; semantic annotations; DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
A study on metadata structure and recommenders of biological systems to support bio-inspired design,"Bio-inspired design was introduced as an alternative method to encourage breakthrough innovations during design projects by stimulating analogical reasoning and thinking of designers. However, the method did not perform as well as researchers expected because most designers, who are novices in the fields of biology and ecology, cannot infer the proper analogue (i.e. biological system) from nature. To resolve this fundamental problem, a causal model based representation framework for `analogical reasoning' - searching and selecting the biological systems to apply - have been developed. In addition, ontology based repository structures and retrieval systems have been proposed to support `analogical thinking' of designers. Nevertheless, these systematic approaches still restrict the candidates and inevitably lose potential biological systems relevant to the design project, due to the `physical relation' biased problem and the ambiguity of the indexing mechanism of both current representation frameworks and retrieval systems. For example, the causality based support system known as a robust representation framework for a single biological system, stores information of a biological system only by its internal `physical relations' and retrieves biological systetabms only by the physical relevance. However, from the perspective of ecological thinking, the further relatedness of physical, biological, and ecological relations' composes the holistic concept used to identify an organism in the flow of evolution because the `biological and ecological relations' are also involved in the traits that designers may be interested in. Therefore, the supplementary information for `biological and ecological relations' must be added to index the biological and environmental interactions, and to use the connectivity among entire organisms in the retrieval process. In this research, a causality based holistic representation framework for biological systems and an `all-connected' ontology based repository and retrieval system are developed as a knowledge-based recommendation system to support bio-inspired design. The knowledge-based system we developed allows engineering designers to search and select a particular biological system and extract design strategy without much biological knowledge. This effort provides more opportunities in a bio-inspired design process by adding potential biological systems that might previously not have been considered.",2017,"Kim, Sun-Joong; Lee, Ji-Hyun",ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,Ontology; Bio-inspired design; Recommendation system; Knowledge-based system; Biological system metadata modeling
Mining affective experience for a kansei design study on a recliner,"As the technical performance of products progresses, it is becoming more important to design products that satisfy customers' affective experiences. Hence, many studies about Kansei engineering or Kansei design have been conducted to develop products that can satisfy customers' affective experiences. In the Kansei design method, it is important to select affective variables related to the design elements of the product in order to accurately grasp the emotions of customers. Therefore, this study seeks to develop an affective variable extraction methodology that can reflect users' implicit needs effectively and efficiently. In this study, users' affective variables were extracted from online reviews and classified using a self-organizing map (SOM). For verification, the study selected the Amazon e-commerce service and performed a product experiment on recliners. The experimental results show that the most frequently used affective variable in the use of recliners is `comfort', which is related to various affective variables. In addition, 15 clusters for affective experiences of recliners extracted from Amazon.com were classified through the SOM. The findings suggest that text mining techniques and the SOM can be used to gather and analyze customers' affective experiences effectively and efficiently. The results of this study can also enhance an understanding of customers' emotions regarding recliners.",2019,"Kim, Wonjoon; Ko, Taehoon; Rhiu, Ilsun; Yun, Myung Hwan",APPLIED ERGONOMICS,Text-mining; Kansei engineering; User experience; Recliner; Self-organizing map (SOM)
A functional concept ontology and its application to automatic identification of functional structures,"Functionality of artifacts as well as structure and behavior plays crucial roles in problem-solving such as design. This article discusses automatic identifications of functional structures of artifacts from given behavioral models of components and their connection information (called functional understanding). We propose a functional concept ontology which provides a rich vocabulary representing functions together with clear definitions grounded on behavior. The ontology enables the automatic identification system to make the search in the functional space tractable and to screen out meaningless interpretations. Furthermore, the ontology includes a new category of functional concepts named meta-functions representing conceptual categories of interdependency between functions. It plays a crucial role in consolidation of functions to give criteria of grouping functions, that is, identity of consolidated functions. It enables the identification system to generate such functional hierarchies that do not correspond to physical structure.

Construction of house of quality for new product planning: A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach,"A house of quality (HOQ) diagram is used to analyze the critical factors involved in the quality function deployment (QFD) processes for the new product planning (NPP). The principal tasks of the QFD acting process comprise describing and scoring customer requirements (CRs); determining design requirements (DRs), the relationship between CRs and DRs, the correlations among CRs, and the correlations among DRs. Finally, the DRs can be scored by these assessments in NPP. This study proposes various methods of scoring the requirements of current and potential customers to reflect the knowledge and preference differences among different customers regarding CRs. The CR scores provided by different customers can be assessed by using linguistic, numerical, and interval values, or can be assessed using linguistic label sets with different granularity. A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic computational approach is adopted to aggregate the CR importance scores obtained from customers by using various methods. In addition, to accurately rate the DRs, a modified relationship between CRs and DRs is proposed. The proposed HOQ construction model is practical because it prevents the loss of information during the QFD process for NPP. An example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.

Representation and management of requirements: The RAPID-WS project,"RAPID-WS (Requirements Process in Design for Weapon Systems) is an advanced research and development project conducted by the Air Force Armstrong Laboratory, Logistics Research Division, RAPID-WS prototypes and demonstrates decision support system tools and supporting methodologies to improve requirements determination and analysis in a concurrent collaborative environment. In this paper, we concentrate on our approach to the semi-formal representation and capture of requirements. We avoid common assumptions that restrict the subject domain to information processing systems. We also attempt to build a representation that does not force the requirements analyst to do anything that looks like programming in a formal language. We see a requirements document as a set oi constraints imposed on the attributes and relations (properties) of domain entities relevant to the subject artifact throughout the artifact's lifecycle. While earlier research deals only with attribute requirements and views relations as specified a priori, we define both relations and attributes only via requirements. We found that requirements specified in typical requirements documents can be classified into a relatively small set of formal types and modalities. Requirements can be decomposed into simple requirement statements, and most of the simple requirement statements have the same generalized structure. Based on these findings, we propose a frame-based Requirements Specification Language (RSL) which is semi-formal in the sense that it contains elements (textual descriptions) which require human interpretation.",1995,"Kott, A; Peasant, JL",CONCURRENT ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,knowledge representation; system design; requirements engineering; document management; formal specification; frame-based language
On user rationale in software engineering,"Rationale refers to the reasoning and justification behind human decisions, opinions, and beliefs. In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g., about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We identified a moderate positive correlation between issues and criteria and furthermore assessed the distribution of rationale concepts with respect to rating and verbosity. We found that issues tend to appear more in lower star rated reviews, while criteria, alternatives, and justifications seem to appear more in three star rated reviews. Also, reviews reporting alternatives seem to be more verbose than reviews reporting criteria. A follow-up qualitative study of sub-concepts revealed, that users also report other alternatives (e.g., alternative software provider), criteria (e.g., cost), and decisions (e.g., on rating software). We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. We evaluated the classification algorithms Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier using a baseline and random configuration. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98%. On the review level, precision was up to 13% higher with recall values reaching 99%. Using only word features, we achieved in most cases the highest precision and highest recall respectively using the Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithm. We discuss the findings and the rationale importance for supporting deliberation in user communities and synthesizing the reviews for developers.",2018,"Kurtanovic, Zijad; Maalej, Walid",REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING,Review mining; App analytics; Rationale
Automatic Discovery of Design Task Structure Using Deep Belief Nets,"With the arrival of cyber physical world and an extensive support of advanced information technology (IT) infrastructure, nowadays it is possible to obtain the footprints of design activities through emails, design journals, change logs, and different forms of social data. In order to manage a more effective design process, it is essential to learn from the past by utilizing these valuable sources and understand, for example, what design tasks are actually carried out, their interactions, and how they impact each other. In this paper, a computational approach based on the deep belief nets (DBN) is proposed to automatically uncover design tasks and quantify their interactions from design document archives. First, a DBN topic model with real-valued units is developed to learn a set of intrinsic topic features from a simple word-frequency-based input representation. The trained DBN model is then utilized to discover design tasks by unfolding hidden units by sets of strongly connected words, followed by estimating the interactions among tasks on the basis of their co-occurrence frequency in a hidden topic space. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated through a real-life case study using a design email archive spanning for more than 2 yr.",2017,"Lan, LJ; Liu, Y; Lu, WF",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; STRUCTURE MATRIX; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
Learning From the Past: Uncovering Design Process Models Using an Enriched Process Mining,"Design documents and design project footprints accumulated by corporate information technology systems have increasingly become valuable sources of evidence for design information and knowledge management. Identification and extraction of such embedded information and knowledge into a clear and usable format will greatly accelerate continuous learning from past design efforts for competitive product innovation and efficient design process management in future design projects. Most of the existing design information extraction systems focus on either organizing design documents for efficient retrieval or extracting relevant product information for product optimization. Different from traditional systems, this paper proposes a methodology of learning and extracting useful knowledge using past design project documents from design process perspective based on process mining techniques. Particularly different from conventional techniques that deal with timestamps or event logs only, a new process mining approach that is able to directly process textual data is proposed at the first stage of the proposed methodology. The outcome is a hierarchical process model that reveals the actual design process hidden behind a large amount of design documents and enables the connection of various design information from different perspectives. At the second stage, the discovered process model is analyzed to extract multifaceted knowledge patterns by applying a number of statistical analysis methods. The outcomes range from task dependency study from workflow analysis, identification of irregular task execution from performance analysis, cooperation pattern discovery from social net analysis to evaluation of personal contribution based on role analysis. Relying on the knowledge patterns extracted, lessons and best practices can be uncovered which offer great support to decision makers in managing any future design initiatives. The proposed methodology was tested using an email dataset from a university-hosted multiyear multidisciplinary design project.",2018,"Lan, LJ; Liu, Y; Lu, WF",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,design informatics; machine learning; process mining; text mining; design information extraction; process analysis; CAD MODELS; RETRIEVAL
Navigating a product landscape for technology opportunity analysis: A word2vec approach using an integrated patent-product database,"Technology opportunity analysis has been the subject of many prior studies, although most of them have focused on discovering new technology ideas in a single narrow domain. This study proposes a product landscape analysis to identify product areas (i.e., potential technology opportunities) across multiple domains that firms can enter based on the technological capabilities embodied in their existing products. First, text mining is used to construct an integrated patent-product database from the United States patent and trademark database. Second, word2vec is employed to construct a product landscape as a vector space model where products with similar technological bases are located close to each other while maintaining the technological relationships. Third, given a product of interest, potential technology opportunities are identified via (1) automatic opportunity analysis that identifies product areas with technological bases similar to those of the product; and (2) interactive opportunity analysis that finds product areas based on experts' queries modifying the technological bases of the product (i.e., addition and subtraction). Finally, ten quantitative indexes are developed to explore the implications of the potential technology opportunities identified. The case study covering 3,016,315 patents and 160,832 products confirms that the proposed approach is valuable as a creativity support tool for technology opportunity analysis in the era of convergence.",2020,"Lee, Changyong; Jeon, Daeseong; Ahn, Joon Mo; Kwon, Ohjin",TECHNOVATION,Index analysis; Integrated patent-product database; Product landscape analysis; Technology opportunity analysis; Word2vec
Categorizing biological information based on function-morphology for bioinspired conceptual design,"A function-based keyword search is a concept generation methodology studied in the bioinspired design area that conveys textual biological inspiration for engineering design. Current keyword search methods are inefficient primarily due to the knowledge gap between engineering and biology domains. To improve current keyword search methods, we propose an algorithm that extracts and organizes morphology-based solutions from biological text. WordNet is utilized to discover morphological solutions in biological text. The novel algorithm also adapts latent semantic analysis and the expectation-maximization algorithm to categorize morphological solutions and group biological text. We introduce a novel penalty function that reflects the distance between functions (problems) and morphologies (solutions). The penalty function allows the algorithm to extract morphological solutions directly related to a design problem. We compare the output of the algorithm to manually extracted solutions for validation. A case study is included to exemplify the utility of the developed algorithm. Upon implementation of the algorithm, engineering designers can discover innovative solutions in biological text in a straightforward, efficient manner.",2017,"Lee, S; Mcadams, DA; Morris, E",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Bioinspired Design; Conceptual Design; Keyword Search; Morphology; Text Mining; 
Mining transportation logs for understanding the after-assembly block manufacturing process in the shipbuilding industry,"In the after-assembly block manufacturing process in the shipbuilding industry, domain experts or industrial managers have the following questions regarding the first step in terms of reducing the overhead transportation cost due to irregularities not defined in a process design: “What tasks are bottlenecks?” and “How long do the blocks remain waiting in stockyards?” We provide the answers to these two questions. In the process mining framework, we propose a method automatically extracting the most frequent task flows from transport usage histories. Considering characteristics of our application, we use a clustering technique to identify heterogeneous groups of process instances, and then derive a process model independently by group. Process models extracted from real-world transportation logs, are verified by domain experts and labelled based on their interpretations. Consequently, we conceptualize the “standard process” from one global process model. Moreover, local models derived from groups of process instances reflect unknown context regarding characteristics of blocks. Our proposed method can provide conceptualized process models and process (or waiting in stockyards) times as a performance indicator. Providing reasonable answers to their questions, it helps domain experts better understand and manage the actual process. With the extension of the conventional methodology for our application problem, the main contributions of this research are that our proposed approach provides insight into the after-assembly block manufacturing process, and describes the first step for reducing transportation costs.

Discovering emerging business ideas based on crowdfunded software projects,"User-centered innovation has attracted considerable interest for exploiting emerging business ideas. We suggest a novel framework for discovering emerging business ideas and their combination with user-centered innovation in the software industry based on design thinking processes. We apply topic modeling to projects on Kickstarter which is one of the largest crowdfunding platforms in the world, We adopt conjoint analysis to find which topics are most preferred upon the platform in terms of the amount of funding that they have received. From our findings, the convergence of smart assistant services with various domains, such as tutoring mathematics and seeking job opportunities, is recommended as an emerging idea for software businesses. We also find that the ideas preferred in the US are different from those preferred in other countries. Our findings can be exploited effectively for decision support in establishing a new business model. Finally, this study contributes to discovering emerging business ideas by connecting user-centered innovation with a design thinking perspective.",2019,"Lee, Won Sang; Sohn, So Young",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Design thinking; Crowdfunding; User-centered innovation
Using evolutionary algorithms to select text features for mining design rationale,"At its heart, design is a decision-making process. These decisions, and the reasons for making them, comprise the design rationale (DR) for the designed artifact. If available, DR provides a comprehensive record of the reasoning behind the decisions made during the design. Unfortunately, while this information is potentially quite valuable, it is usually not explicitly captured. Instead, it is often buried in other design and development artifacts. In this paper, we study how to identify rationale from text documents, specifically software bug reports and design discussion transcripts. The method we examined is statistical text mining where a model is built to use document features to classify sentences. Choosing which features are most likely to be good predictors is important. We studied two evolutionary algorithms to optimize feature selection - ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms. We found that for many types of rationale, models built with an optimized feature set outperformed those built using all the document features.",2020,"Lester, M; Guerrero, M; Burge, J",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Ant colony optimization; design rationale; feature selection; genetic algorithms; text mining; COLONY; OPTIMIZATION
An approach for design rationale retrieval using ontology-aided indexing,"Design rationale (DR) is an important part of design knowledge. Effective reuse of DR depends on its successful retrieval. In this paper, an approach for structured DR retrieval using ontology-aided indexing is presented. Firstly, an ontology-based semantic model of DR is developed based on the extended IBIS-based DR representation in order to effectively utilise the semantics embedded in DR. Then, an ontology-aided indexing method is proposed to build indexes for DR records to index the semantic concepts and relationships in DR. Furthermore, three kinds of query modes are developed to support flexible querying, among which natural language input query and DR record-based query have much more semantics and thus lead to better retrieval results. Finally, a prototype system is implemented. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2014,"Li, LY; Qin, FW; Gao, SM; Liu, Y",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,design rationale; ontology; design rationale retrieval; design knowledge reuse; ENGINEERING DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; KNOWLEDGE; REUSE
Product family lean improvement based on matching deep mining of customer group preference,"Mining user preferences from online reviews to understand the representative preferences of different customer groups plays a critical role in product development and improvement, especially in personalized product design. Previous research on mining user preferences usually assumes that all consumers' preferences are homogenous and does not take differences in consumers' personalities into account. Besides, traditional online review deep mining methods are too broad to focus on precise and detailed mining of customer preferences. To fill the gaps in existing research, our study develops a template matching deep mining method to segment customers and narrow the mining scope of customer group preference, and then proposes a product family lean improvement model. Firstly, K-means and structural change model are applied to cluster customers reliably based on the similarity of user preferences. Secondly, in order to decrease down mining scope of customer group preference, the Improved Deep Structured Semantic Model is designed to determine sentimental polarity sentimental polarity of different groups by matching the standard sentimental polarity review templates and online reviews. Finally, a KANO mapping model is developed to decide the user preferences for product attributes in each customer group according to their sentimental polarity and further summarize the common preferences and personalized preferences of various groups according to the Preference Commonality Measurement Function. Accordingly, product family lean improvement strategies are proposed to provide product developers with improvement directions. An empirical study is carried out on laptop data on JD.COM to verify the validity of the proposed model and product family lean improvement suggestions are put forward.",2021,"Li, Shugang; Liu, Fang; Lu, Hanyu; Zhang, Yuqi; Li, Yueming; Yu, Zhaoxu",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Online reviews; Customer group; Matching deep mining; Preference diversity; Product family improvement
A context-aware diversity-oriented knowledge recommendation approach for smart engineering solution design,"To proactively fulfill multiple stakeholders' needs in the engineering solution design process, the knowledge recommendation approach is adopted as a key element in the knowledge management system. Nevertheless, most existing knowledge recommendation approaches cannot simultaneously meet the higher standard of in-context accuracy and diversity. To address the issue, this paper proposes a context-aware diversity-oriented knowledge recommendation approach, thereby assisting stakeholders to accomplish engineering solution design in a smarter manner. Three diversity concerns, namely item-diversity, context-diversity, and user-diversity are addressed by semantic-based content analysis, context definition and awareness, and user profile modeling, respectively. Hence, the proposed approach not only maximizes the diversity of the recommended knowledge but also guarantees its accuracy under multiple problem-solving contexts. Moreover, a practical engineering solution design case on a Smart 3D printer platform is conducted, to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in providing usable and diverse knowledge items. It is anticipated this work can provide useful insights to practitioners in their knowledge-based engineering solution design process. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Exploiting knowledge graphs in industrial products and services: A survey of key aspects, challenges, and future perspectives","The rapid development of information and communication technologies has enabled a value co-creation paradigm for developing industrial products and services, where massive heterogeneous data and multidisciplinary knowledge are generated and leveraged. In this context, Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a promising tool to elicit, fuse, process, and utilize numerous entities and relationships embedded in products and services, as well as their stakeholders. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is scarcely any comprehensive and thorough discussion about making full use of KG's potentials to solve pain points of product development and service innovation in the industry. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper conducted a systematic survey of KG exploitations in industrial products and services and the customizations towards higher adaptability to practices. The authors selected 119 representative papers (up to 10/03/2021) together with other 29 supplementary works to summarize the technical and practical efforts and discuss the current challenges of exploiting KG in industrial products and services. Meantime, this work also highlights enhancing KG's availability and boosting its productivity in industrial products and services development as the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can provide a basis for the explorations and implementations of KG-supported industrial product and services development, and attract more open discussions to the exploitation of KG-enabled industrial information systems.

A Knowledge Graph-Aided Concept-Knowledge Approach for Evolutionary Smart Product-Service System Development,"In order to meet user expectations and to optimize user experience with a higher degree of flexibility and sustainability, the Smart product-service system (Smart PSS), as a novel value proposition paradigm considering both online and offline smartness, was proposed. However, conventional manners for developing PSS require many professional consultations and still cannot meet with the new features of Smart PSS, such as user context-awareness and ever-evolving knowledge management. Therefore, aiming to assist Smart PSS development cost-effectively, this paper adopted the knowledge graph (KG) technique and concept-knowledge (C-K) model to propose an evolutionary design approach. Two knowledge graphs are firstly established with open-source knowledge, prototype specifications, and user-generated textual data. Then, triggered by personalized requirements, four KG-aided C-K operators are conducted based on graph-based query patterns and computational linguistics algorithms, thus generating innovative solutions for evolving Smart PSS. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, a case study of a smart nursing bed fulfilling multiple personalized requirements is conducted, and the evaluation result of its knowledge evolution is acceptable. It hopes that this work can offer insightful guidance to industrial organizations in their development of Smart PSS.",2020,"Li, XY; Chen, CH; Zheng, P; Wang, ZX; Jiang, ZH; Jiang, ZX",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,knowledge graph; concept-knowledge model; smart product-service system; knowledge evolution; conceptual design; creativity and concept generation; DESIGN APPROACH; DATA ANALYTICS; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS
Extracting topic-sensitive content from textual documents-A hybrid topic model approach,"When exploring information of a topic, users often concern its different aspects. For instance, product designers are interested in seeking information of specific topic aspects such as technical challenge and usability from online consumer opinions, while potential buyers wish to obtain general sentiment of public opinions. In this paper, we study an interesting problem called topic-sensitive content extraction (TSCE). TSCE aims to extract contents that are relevant to the samples of topic aspects highlighted by users from a single document in a given text collection. To tackle TSCE, we have proposed a new hybrid topic model which integrates different structures in both topic space and context space. It focuses on identifying contents associated with a specified topic aspect from each document. By modeling gradient documents via term profiles for context modeling and by leveraging local and global differences between probability distributions over words in both topic modeling and context modeling, it has better captured the features of various language patterns. Hence, sentence relevance ranking according to a specific topic aspect is largely improved. The experimental studies on extracting critical contents of specific aspects, including motivation and design solution, from technical patents for design analysis have shown the merits of the proposed modeling.

Learning the “Whys”: Discovering design rationale using text mining - An algorithm perspective,"Collecting design rationale (DR) and making it available in a well-organized manner will better support product design, innovation and decision-making. Many DR systems have been developed to capture DR since the 1970s. However, the DR capture process is heavily human involved. In addition, with the increasing amount of DR available in archived design documents, it has become an acute problem to research a new computational approach that is able to capture DR from free textual contents effectively. In our previous study, we have proposed an ISAL (issue, solution and artifact layer) model for DR representation. In this paper, we focus on algorithm design to discover DR from design documents according to the ISAL modeling. For the issue layer of the ISAL model, we define a semantic sentence graph to model sentence relationships through language patterns. Based on this graph, we improve the manifold-ranking algorithm to extract issue-bearing sentences. To discover solution-reason bearing sentences for the solution layer, we propose building up two sentence graphs based on candidate solution-bearing sentences and reason-bearing sentences respectively, and propagating information between them. For artifact information extraction, we propose two term relations, i.e. positional term relation and mutual term relation. Using these relations, we extend our document profile model to score the candidate terms. The performance and scalability of the algorithms proposed are tested using patents as research data joined with an example of prior art search to illustrate its application prospects.

Revealing insights of users' perception: an approach to evaluate wearable products based on emotions,"The wearable product market is growing rapidly and is full of products with similar functions and features. Engaging users at an emotional level may be the key to differentiating a product and encouraging long-term use. While researchers have proposed various design approaches to realize design qualities for wearable devices, emotional needs are often extracted by analysis-heavy methods and disconnected in the design process. To bridge this gap, we developed a new approach that uses a two-axis interactive collage tool for users to compare and evaluate wearable products with targeted emotion-related descriptive words. This approach enabled designers to explore how users perceive products and identify types of emotions that were associated with users' preferences for and perception of the product's form and visible characteristics. The example study demonstrated this approach by exploring the relationships between product characteristics and design goals, such as user comfort, user delight, and perceived product usefulness. The results showed that products that resemble clothing were perceived as more delightful and comfortable. The approach can be further used to explore other design concepts or goals.",2020,"Liao, T; Tanner, K; MacDonald, EF",DESIGN SCIENCE,wearable design; product evaluation; product perception; design for emotions; CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGY
A Bayesian Sampling Method for Product Feature Extraction From Large-Scale Textual Data,"The authors of this work propose an algorithm that determines optimal search keyword combinations for querying online product data sources in order to minimize identification errors during the product feature extraction process. Data-driven product design methodologies based on acquiring and mining online product-feature-related data are presented with two fundamental challenges: (1) determining optimal search keywords that result in relevant product related data being returned and (2) determining how many search keywords are sufficient to minimize identification errors during the product feature extraction process. These challenges exist because online data, which is primarily textual in nature, may violate several statistical assumptions relating to the independence and identical distribution of samples relating to a query. Existing design methodologies have predetermined search terms that are used to acquire textual data online, which makes the resulting data acquired, a function of the quality of the search term(s) themselves. Furthermore, the lack of independence and identical distribution of text data from online sources impacts the quality of the acquired data. For example, a designer may search for a product feature using the term screen, which may return relevant results such as  the screen size is just perfect, but may also contain irrelevant noise such as  researchers should really screen for this type of error. A text mining algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal terms without labeled training data that would maximize the veracity of the data acquired to make a valid conclusion.

A concept-based information retrieval approach for engineering domain-specific technical documents,"Technical documents, which often have complicated structures, are often produced during Architecture/Engineering/Construction (A/E/C) projects and research. Applying information retrieval (IR) techniques directly to long or multi-topic documents often does not lead to satisfactory results. One way to address the problem is to partition each document into several “passages”, and treat each passage as an independent document. In this research, a novel passage partitioning approach is designed. It generates passages according to domain knowledge, which is represented by base domain ontology. Such a passage is herein defined as an OntoPassage. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the OntoPassage partitioning approach, this research implements a concept-based IR system to illustrate the application of such an approach. The research also compares the OntoPassage partitioning approach with several conventional passage partitioning approaches to verify its IR effectiveness. It is shown that, with the proposed OntoPassage approach, IR effectiveness on domain-specific technical reports is as good as conventional passage partitioning approaches. In addition, the OntoPassage approach provides the possibility to display the concepts in each passage, and concept-based IR may thus be implemented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Design by Analogy: A Study of the WordTree Method for Problem Re-Representation,"This paper presents a novel approach, referred to as the WordTree design-by-analogy method, for identifying distant-domain analogies as part of the ideation process. The WordTree method derives its effectiveness through a design team's knowledge and readily available information sources (e. g., patent databases, Google) and does not require specialized computational knowledge bases. A controlled cognitive experiment and an evaluation of the method with redesign projects illustrate the method's influence in assisting engineers in design-by-analogy. Individuals using the WordTree method identified significantly more analogies and searched outside the problem domain as compared to the control group. The team redesign projects demonstrate the WordTree method's effectiveness in longer-term, more realistic, higher validity team projects and with a variety of different design problems. Teams successfully identified effective analogies, analogous domains, and analogous patents. Unexpected and unique solutions are identified using the method. For example, one of the teams identified a dump truck and panning for gold as effective analogies for the design of a self-cleaning cat litter box. In the controlled experiment, a cherry pitter was identified and implemented as a solution for designing a machine to shell peanuts. The experimental results also highlight potential improvements for the method and areas for future research in engineering design theory.

Data-Driven Concept Network for Inspiring Designers' Idea Generation,"Big-data mining brings new challenges and opportunities for engineering design, such as customer-needs mining, sentiment analysis, knowledge discovery, etc. At the early phase of conceptual design, designers urgently need to synthesize their own internal knowledge and wide external knowledge to solve design problems. However, on the one hand, it is time-consuming and laborious for designers to manually browse massive volumes of web documents and scientific literature to acquire external knowledge. On the other hand, how to extract concepts and discover meaningful concept associations automatically and accurately from these textual data to inspire designers' idea generation? To address the above problems, we propose a novel data-driven concept network based on machine learning to capture design concepts and meaningful concept combinations as useful knowledge by mining the web documents and literature, which is further exploited to inspire designers to generate creative ideas. Moreover, the proposed approach contains three key steps: concept vector representation based on machine learning, semantic distance quantification based on concept clustering, and possible concept combinations based on natural language processing technologies, which is expected to provide designers with inspirational stimuli to solve design problems. A demonstration of conceptual design for detecting the fault location in transmission lines has been taken to validate the practicability and effectiveness of this approach.",2020,"Liu, QY; Wang, K; Li, Y; Liu, Y",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,big data and analytics; data-driven engineering; engineering Informatics; knowledge engineering; machine learning for engineering applications; KNOWLEDGE; REPRESENTATION; SIMULATION; CREATIVITY; DOMAIN; LINK; MAP
A New Design Rationale Representation Model for Rationale Mining,"The management of design rationale (DR) in engineering design is an important task since DR is often regarded as crucial information in design decision support and design analysis. The existing DR systems largely rely on human efforts in capturing DRs along design activities according to some predefined DR models. However these systems require heavy human involvement and they do not have the capacity to extract DRs from design archival documents, which contain rich DR information but are usually unstructured or semistructured texts, e.g., design documents, service reports, and test reports. In view of such challenges, it has motivated us to propose a new DR model to intelligently discover DRs from design archival documents. In this paper, we propose an issue, solution and artifact layer (ISAL) model for DR representation and approaches for rationale information discovery from design archival documents. We also introduce a DR repository construction platform based on the ISAL model by integrating rationale information from both design archival documents and design processes. Using patent documents as our research data, we conduct a conceptual comparison and experimental study of DR discovery especially for artifact information extraction. Results demonstrate the merits of our proposal. Lastly we discuss potential applications by taking advantage of our ISAL model.

A new function-based patent knowledge retrieval tool for conceptual design of innovative products,"The reuse of design knowledge within a specific domain is currently a major research focus in product design. However, the importance of support from cross-domain knowledge is steadily on the increase for product innovative design, which includes multi-domain knowledge recombination, transfer and transformation. As the biggest knowledge provider, patent information plays an irreplaceable role inspiring designers in the conceptual design stage. Nevertheless, it is of a great importance and also an issue to figure out how to efficiently retrieve cross-domain patents. In this paper, we propose a function-based patent knowledge retrieval tool for conceptual design of innovative products. In order to establish the underlying local database, function information, technical terms and International Patent Classification (IPC) information are respectively extracted from patents crawled on Websites to represent function, technology and domain properties, thereby generating a patent knowledge space. Particularly, by using a semi-supervised learning algorithm, function information is automatically classified and labeled by functional basis, into which the design problem is abstracted and interpreted forming a design problem space. By functional basis mapping from the design problem space to the patent knowledge space, we retrieve the required cross-domain patents, which are then clustered and evaluated in accordance with the extracted technology and domain properties. The selected patents are thus purposefully recommended to trigger designers' creativity. Finally, a case study illustrates the conceptual design process based on the proposed retrieval tool. In addition to that, we conducted an experiment to verify our tool. It demonstrates that our proposed tool can assist designers to generate more ideas and the novelty of ideas is higher.

Promoting risk communication in early design through linguistic analyses,"The concept of function offers significant potential for transforming thinking and reasoning about engineering design as well as providing a common thread for relating together product risk information. This paper focuses specifically on risk data by examining how this information is addressed for a design team conducting early stage design for space missions. A fundamental set of risk elements is proposed based on a linguistic analysis of the risk information needs of the design team. Sample risk statements are then decomposed into a set of key attributes that are used to scrutinize the risk information using three approaches from the pragmatics sub-field of linguistics: (1) Gricean, (2) Relevance Theory, and (3) Functional Analysis. Based on the deficiencies identified in this analysis, a format for the communication of risk data by explicitly accounting for five risk attributes developed in this work is formulated.",2009,"Lough, KG; Van Wie, M; Stone, R; Tumer, IY",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Risk analysis; Linguistics; Product design; 
Guiding data-driven design ideation by knowledge distance,"Data-driven conceptual design methods and tools aim to inspire human ideation for new design concepts by providing external inspirational stimuli. In prior studies, the stimuli have been limited in terms of coverage, granularity, and retrieval guidance. Here, we present a knowledge-based expert system that provides design stimuli across the semantic, document and field levels simultaneously from all fields of engineering and technology and that follows creativity theories to guide the retrieval and use of stimuli according to the knowledge distance. The system is centered on the use of a network of all technology fields in the patent classification system, to store and organize the world's cumulative data on the technological knowledge, concepts and solutions in the total patent database according to statistically-estimated knowledge distance between technology fields. In turn, knowledge distance guides the network-based exploration and retrieval of inspirational stimuli for inferences across near and far fields to generate new design ideas by analogy and combination. With two case studies, we showcase the effectiveness of using the system to explore and retrieve multilevel inspirational stimuli and generate new design ideas for both problem solving and open-ended innovation. These case studies also demonstrate the computer-aided ideation process, which is data-driven, computationally augmented, theoretically grounded, visually inspiring, and rapid. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

On the automatic classification of app reviews,"App stores like Google Play and Apple AppStore have over 3 million apps covering nearly every kind of software and service. Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. The majority of the reviews, however, is rather non-informative just praising the app and repeating to the star ratings in words. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and text ratings. For this, we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with simple text classification and natural language preprocessing of the text-particularly with bigrams and lemmatization-the classification precision for all review types got up to 88-92 % and the recall up to 90-99 %. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers. Our results inspired the design of a review analytics tool, which should help app vendors and developers deal with the large amount of reviews, filter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders. We describe the tool main features and summarize nine interviews with practitioners on how review analytics tools including ours could be used in practice.",2016,"Maalej, Walid; Kurtanovic, Zijad; Nabil, Hadeer; Stanik, Christoph",REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING,Machine learning; Natural language processing; Data-driven requirements engineering; Review analytics; Software analytics; User feedback
Discourse analysis based segregation of relevant document segments for knowledge acquisition,"Documents are a useful source of expert knowledge in organizations and can be used to foresee, in an earlier stage of a product's life cycle, potential issues and solutions that might occur in later stages of its life cycle. In this research, these stages are, respectively, design and assembly. Even if these documents are available online, it is rather difficult for users to access the knowledge contained in these documents. It is therefore desirable to automatically extract the knowledge contained in these documents and store them in a computer accessible or manipulable form. This paper describes an approach for the first step in this acquisition process: automatically identifying segments of documents that are relevant to aircraft assembly, so that they can be further processed for acquiring expert knowledge. Such identification of relevant segments is necessary for avoiding processing of unrelated information that is costly and possibly distracting for domain relevance. The approach to extracting relevant segments has two steps. The first step is the identification of sentences that form a coherent segment of text, within which the topic does not shift. The second step is to classify segments that are within the topics of interest for knowledge acquisition, that is, aircraft assembly in this instance. These steps filter out segments that are unrelated, and therefore need not be processed for subsequent knowledge acquisition. The steps are implemented by understanding the contents of documents. Using methods of discourse analysis, in particular, discourse representation theory, a list of discourse entities is obtained. The difference in discourse entities between sentences is used to distinguish between segments. The list of discourse entities in a segment is compared against a domain ontology for classification. The implementation and results of validation on sample texts for these steps are described.",2016,"Madhusudanan, N; Chakrabarti, A; Gurumoorthy, B",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Aircraft Assembly; Discourse Analysis; Discourse Representation Theory; Text Segmentation; DESIGN; CHALLENGES; RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM
From natural language text to rules: knowledge acquisition from formal documents for aircraft assembly,"Knowledge acquisition is a well-acknowledged bottleneck in the building of knowledge-based systems. Documents are a useful source of knowledge from experts. This paper targets the reuse of knowledge from the assembly phase of a product in the design and planning phases. Issues, their causes and the parameters involved are necessary to be acquired for reusing the knowledge so acquired. This paper discusses a method for knowledge acquisition, as a pipeline of existing tools in natural language understanding and processing. The acquired knowledge is expected to help in the decision making for a smart manufacturing system. The process of knowledge acquisition involves recognising the presence of issues and their causes using a combination of sentiment analysis and text patterns. The causes are then dissected to identify the constraints and constituent parameters. These pieces of knowledge are then reconstructed to form rules in a knowledge base. This paper demonstrates progress towards realising the method, by developing the cause dissection and rule-writing components, and validation of the issue-cause acquisition component with human subjects. A discussion is then presented on the potential integration and validation of the overall knowledge acquisition pipeline with a smart manufacturing system.",2019,"Madhusudanan, N; Gurumoorthy, B; Chakrabarti, A",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Knowledge acquisition; natural language text; aircraft assembly; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; DISCOVERY; EXPERTISE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; AI
Prediction of Kansei engineering features for bottle design by a Knowledge Based System,"The aesthetic appeal of industrial products is an important requirement in the modern global market; even more relevant in case of large-scale products without special requirements in terms of performances such as bottles for mass distribution. The present paper proposes a Knowledge-Based System that integrates a semi-automatic tool for product design generation with a concept-tool for predicting the emotional impact of bottle design. With the aim to ensure the feasibility of the product without modifying the designer intention, the system combines rules and constraints related to geometries, materials, manufacturing processes, the top load and the inner pressure resistance. It is focused on a predictive case-based procedure, which exploits Artificial Neural Networks performances. The implemented tool assists the user to elaborate a preliminary forecast about the perception of an object based on some of its features through the Kansei engineering approach.",2018,"Mele, Mattia; Campana, Giampaolo",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM,Emotional design; Artificial Neural Network; Bottle design; Bottle manufacturing; Kansey engineering; Knowledge-Based System
Verbal focus shifts: Forms of low coherent statements in design conversations,Previous studies on design behaviour indicate that focus shifts positively influence ideational productivity. In this study we want to take a closer look at how these focus shifts look on the verbal level. We describe a mutually influencing relationship between mental focus shifts and verbal low coherent statements. In a case study based on the DTRS11 dataset we identify 297 low coherent statements via a combined topic modelling and manual approach. We introduce a categorization of the different instances of low coherent statements. The results indicate that designers tend to shift topics within an existing design issue instead of completely disrupting it. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing textual databases using data mining to enable fast product development processes,"Currently, companies active in the design of high-tech products are confronted with a number of, often conflicting, challenges. Not only do they have to develop increasingly complex products in ever-shorter amounts of time but they also have to produce them cheaply for the local as well as global markets. In order to manage these conflicting trends adequately, as this paper will demonstrate, companies need to have high quality information at the right moment and at the right location. This serves as the motivation of this paper in which various databases within the product life cycle are examined. Due to the fact that unanticipated information plays a more and more dominant role, especially in highly innovative business processes, we focus our attention on textual databases since textual databases offer the best possibility to handle unanticipated free-formatted information. Also their treatment in the literature has thus far been scant. As will be demonstrated in this paper these databases have a huge potential for valuable information. Further, an analysis tool, data mining that could be used to analyse these textual databases so that we could extract information from them quickly and hence be able to access them at the right time when needed, is presented. We also highlight some of the difficulties faced when analyzing textual databases. Thus with the right information from the textual databases and the tools to deliver this information at the right time companies, would definitely be able to shorten development times and hence gain a competitive edge.

Development of design system for crack patterns on cup surface based on KANSEI,"With the development of manufacturing technology in recent years, as well as with the industrial product development, differentiation in the design aspect is becoming effective, not in terms of performance or quality. In addition, as consumers seek products that match their own sensibilities (KANSEI), designers are required to propose designs that highly conform to concept presented by client, while understanding the KANSEI of diversified consumers; therefore, their burden is increasing. To address these issues, the support of the development of computer-aided design has advanced; however, it is difficult to reflect human KANSEI or to generate a design that induces a natural impression through computers. The purpose of this research is to develop a system that incorporates the KANSEI of users, and emits a pattern design that induces a natural impression using a computer. This work is focused on crack patterns that can be observed on pottery surfaces, and a method for generating crack patterns on a cup surface is suggested. In this study, a Bezier curved surface and fluctuation were employed in order to induce a natural impression. In addition, by using the neural network, the crack patterns were associated with user KANSEI The neural network was composed of three layers, namely the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer; it adopted the sigmoid function as the transition function and the back propagation as the learning method. As a result, a system was constructed, in which a crack pattern that satisfied the input produces an output according to the desired impression of the user. Finally, an evaluation questionnaire was distributed, and the usefulness of the system was confirmed. (C) 2018 Society for Computational Design and Engineering.

Measuring textual patent similarity on the basis of combined concepts: design decisions and their consequences,"For certain tasks in patent management it makes sense to apply a quantitative measure of textual similarity between patents and/or parts thereof: be it the analysis of freedom to operate, the analysis of technology convergence, or the mapping of patents for strategic purposes. In this paper we intend to outline the process of measuring textual patent similarity on the basis of elements referred to as `combined concepts'. We are going to use this process in various operations leading to design decisions, and shall also provide guidance regarding these decisions. By way of two applications from patent management, namely the prioritization of patents and the analysis of convergence between two technological fields, we mean to demonstrate the crucial importance of design decisions in terms of patent analysis results.",2012,"Moehrle, Martin G.; Gerken, Jan M.",SCIENTOMETRICS,Patent mapping; Convergence analysis; Patent; Prior art analysis; Similarity coefficients; Similarity measurement
Automating requirements analysis and test case generation,"Writing clear and unambiguous requirements that are conflict-free and complete is no easy task. Incorrect requirements lead to errors being introduced early in the design process. The longer the gap between error introduction and error discovery, the higher the cost associated with the error. To address the growing cost of system development, we introduce a tool called Analysis of Semantic Specifications and Efficient generation of Requirements-based Tests (ASSERT (TM)) for capturing requirements, backed by a formal requirements analysis engine. ASSERT also automatically generates a complete set of requirements-based test cases. The requirements are captured in a structured natural language that is both human- and machine-readable. Formal analysis of these requirements with an automated theorem prover identifies errors as soon as requirements are written. It also addresses the historical problem that analysis engines are hard to use and understand for someone without formal methods expertise and analysis results are often difficult for the end-user to understand and make actionable. ASSERT's major contribution is to bring powerful requirements capture and analysis capability to the domain of the end-user. We provide explainable and automated formal analysis, something we found important for a tool's adoptability in industry. Automating test case generation in ASSERT also provides clear and measurable productivity gains in system development.",2019,"Moitra, Abha; Siu, Kit; Crapo, Andrew W.; Durling, Michael; Li, Meng; Manolios, Panagiotis; Meiners, Michael; McMillan, Craig",REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING,Ontology; Requirements engineering; Formal methods; Automated requirements-based test generation; Formal analysis of requirements; Requirements formalization
Searching in Cooperative Patent Classification: Comparison between keyword and concept-based search,"International patent corpus is a gigantic source containing today about 80million of documents. Every patent is manually analyzed by patent officers and then classified by a specific code called Patent Class (PC). Cooperative Patent Classification CPC is the new classification system introduced since January 2013 in order to standardize the classification systems of all major patent offices. Like keywords for papers, PCs point to the core of the invention, describing concisely what they contain inside. Most of patents strategies are based on PC as filter for results therefore the selection of relevant PCs is often a primary and crucial activity. This task is considered particularly challenging and only few tools have been specially developed for this purpose. The most efficient tools are provided by patent offices of EPO and WIPO. This paper analyzes their PCs search strategy (mainly based on keyword-based engines) in order to identify main limitations in terms of missing relevant PCs (recall) and non-relevant results (precision). Patents have been processed by KOM, a semantic patent search tool developed by the authors. Unlike all other PC search tools, KOM uses semantic parser and many knowledge bases for carrying out a conceptual patent search. Its functioning is described step by step through a detailed analysis pointing out the benefits of a concept-based search vis-à-vis a keyword-based search. An exemplary case is proposed dealing with CPCs describing the sterilization of contact lenses. Comparison could be likewise conducted on other PCs such as International (IPC), European (ECLA) or United States (USPC) patent classification codes.",2013,"Montecchi, Tiziano; Russo, Davide; Liu, Ying",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Patent mining; Concept-based search; Patent classification
"Comparative analysis of requirements change prediction models: manual, linguistic, and neural network","Requirement change propagation, if not managed, may lead to monetary losses or project failure. The a posteriori tracking of requirement dependencies is a well-established practice in project and change management. The identification of these dependencies often requires manual input by one or more individuals with intimate knowledge of the project. Moreover, the definition of these dependencies that help to predict requirement change is not currently found in the literature. This paper presents two industry case studies of predicting system requirement change propagation through three approaches: manually, linguistically, and bag-of-words. Dependencies are manually and automatically developed between requirements from textual data and computationally processed to develop surrogate models to predict change. Two types of relationship generation, manual keyword selection and part-of-speech tagging, are compared. Artificial neural networks are used to create surrogate models to predict change. These approaches are evaluated on three connectedness metrics: shortest path, path count, and maximum flow rate. The results are given in terms of search depth needed within a requirements document to identify the subsequent changes. The semi-automated approach yielded the most accurate results, requiring a search depth of 11 %, but sacrifices on automation. The fully automated approach is able to predict requirement change within a search depth of 15 % and offers the benefits of full minimal human input.",2014,"Morkos, B; Mathieson, J; Summers, JD",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Requirement change; Change propagation; Engineering change; Dependency modelling; Complex system design; CHANGE MANAGEMENT
Modeling the Semantic Structure of Textually Derived Learning Content and its Impact on Recipients' Response States,"In the United States, the greatest decline in the number of students in the STEM education pipeline occurs at the university level, where students, who were initially interested in STEM fields, drop-out or move on to other interests. It has been reported that of the 23 most commonly cited reasons for switching out of STEM, all but 7 had something to do with the pedagogical experience. Thus, understanding the characteristics of the pedagogical experience that impact students' interest in STEM is of great importance to the academic community. This work tests the hypothesis that there exists a correlation between the semantic structure of lecture content and students' affective states. Knowledge gained from testing this hypothesis will inform educators of the specific semantic structure of lecture content that enhance students' affective states and interest in course content, toward the goal of increasing STEM retention rates and overall positive experiences in STEM majors. A case study involving a series of science and engineering based digital content is used to create a semantic network and demonstrate the implications of the methodology. The results reveal that affective states such as engagement and boredom are consistently strongly correlated to the semantic network metrics outlined in the paper, while the affective state of confusion is weakly correlated with the same semantic network metrics. The results reveal semantic network relationships that are generalizable across the different textually derived information sources explored. These semantic network relationships can be explored by researchers trying to optimize their message structure in order to have its intended effect.",2016,"Munoz, D; Tucker, CS",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,semantic network; emotional states; engineering design; text mining; Kansei engineering; design for emotion; CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGY; NETWORK ANALYSIS; DESIGN
Function Based Design-by-Analogy: A Functional Vector Approach to Analogical Search,"Design-by-analogy is a powerful approach to augment traditional concept generation methods by expanding the set of generated ideas using similarity relationships from solutions to analogous problems. While the concept of design-by-analogy has been known for some time, few actual methods and tools exist to assist designers in systematically seeking and identifying analogies from general data sources, databases, or repositories, such as patent databases. A new method for extracting functional analogies from data sources has been developed to provide this capability, here based on a functional basis rather than form or conflict descriptions. Building on past research, we utilize a functional vector space model (VSM) to quantify analogous similarity of an idea's functionality. We quantitatively evaluate the functional similarity between represented design problems and, in this case, patent descriptions of products. We also develop document parsing algorithms to reduce text descriptions of the data sources down to the key functions, for use in the functional similarity analysis and functional vector space modeling. To do this, we apply Zipf's law on word count order reduction to reduce the words within the documents down to the applicable functionally critical terms, thus providing a mapping process for function based search. The reduction of a document into functional analogous words enables the matching to novel ideas that are functionally similar, which can be customized various ways. This approach thereby provides relevant sources of design-by-analogy inspiration. As a verification of the approach, two original design problem case studies illustrate the distance range of analogical solutions that can be extracted. This range extends from very near-field, literal solutions to far-field cross-domain analogies.",2014,"Murphy, J; Fu, K; Otto, K; Yang, M; Jensen, D; Wood, K",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; ENGINEERING DESIGN; ALGORITHM; MODEL
Keyword selection and processing strategy for applying text mining to patent analysis,"Previous studies have applied various methodologies to analyze patent data for technology management, given the advances in data analysis techniques available. In particular, efforts have recently been made to use text-mining (i.e. extracting keywords from patent documents) for patent analysis purposes. The results of these studies may be affected by the keywords selected from the relevant documents but, despite its importance, the existing literature has seldom explored strategies for selecting and processing keywords from patent documents. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap by focusing on keyword strategies for applying text-mining to patent data. Specifically, four factors are addressed; (1) which element of the patent documents to adopt for keyword selection, (2) what keyword selection methods to use, (3) how many keywords to select, and (4) how to transform the keyword selection results into an analyzable data format. An experiment based on an orthogonal array of the four factors was designed in order to identify the best strategy, in which the four factors were evaluated and compared through k-means clustering and entropy values. The research findings are expected to offer useful guidelines for how to select and process keywords for patent analysis, and so further increase the reliability and validity of research using text-mining for patent analysis.

Sentiment Root Cause Analysis Based on Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis and Fuzzy Cognitive Map,"Feature-level sentiment analysis can retrieve the sentimental preferences for the features of products but cannot retrieve the causes of the preferences. Previous sentiment analysis methods used sentiment words to calculate the sentiment polarity for specific features but could not utilize neutral sentiment words, even when they constituted a large proportion of the sentiment words. Fault diagnosis can extract causes and determine the root cause by using factual information and the cause-effect relation, but is not used for sentiment data. For the retrieval of sentiment root causes, we propose a sentiment root cause analysis method for user preferences. We consider sentiment relations based on fuzzy formal concept analysis (FFCA) to extend hierarchical feature-level sentiment analysis. A hierarchical relation of neutral sentiment words and explicit causal relation based on causal conjunctions is utilized to retrieve the cross features of root causes. A sentiment root cause is determined from the extracted causes to explain the preference of a sentiment expression by using a fuzzy cognitive map with a relations method. We demonstrate a factual ontology and sentiment ontology based on a feature ontology for clothing products. We evaluated the proposed sentiment root cause analysis method and verified that it is improved as compared with term frequency-based methods and sentiment score analysis.",2016,"Park, SM; Kim, YG; Baik, DK",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,;
How to design and utilize online customer center to support new product concept generation,"Websites can be effective vehicles for firms to communicate with their customers but the use of websites has been limited to pacifying complaint customers. To better use a website's information, this research presents a framework for extracting customer opinions from websites and transforming them into product specification data. For the purpose, firstly, customer opinions were collected from an online customer center and then transformed into customer needs using text-mining. Then, after customers were segmented into several groups based on their needs, relations among their needs were visualized by co-word analysis and product specifications to meet those needs t analyzed by decision tree. Lastly, a final target product specification for new products were determined and a target market was identified based on customer profile data. The suggested framework enables to incorporate customer opinions efficiently with new product development processes and to design online customer centers to better collect and analyze useful information.

Language definition and its role in developing a design discourse,"Design lacks a reasonable infrastructure including agreement on key terms and their meaning, on what constitutes core knowledge, on structures that support access to researchy and on a discourse that transcends the ephemeral. Lacking a formal structure, design as a discipline has no orderly reference to its resources or tagging for its research. As design emerges as a discipline, it needs to define and agree on basic terms. Language is recognized as a social contract, thus it cannot be successfully imposed.

Customer sentiment appraisal from user-generated product reviews: a domain independent heuristic algorithm,"Social media give new opportunities in customer survey and market survey for design inspiration with comments posted online by users spontaneously, in an oral-near language, and almost free of biases. Opinion mining techniques are being developed, especially customer sentiment analysis. These techniques are most of the time based on a text parsing and costly learning techniques based on target or domain-dependent corpora for getting a fine understanding of users' preferences. On the contrary, in this paper, we propose an overall sentiment rating algorithm, accurate enough to deliver an overall rating on a product review, without a tedious customization to a product domain or customer polarities. The developed algorithm starts by a text parsing, uses a Dictionary of Affect Language to rate the word tree leaves and uses a series of basic heuristics to calculate backward an overall sentiment rating for the review. We validate it on the example of a commercial home theatre system, comparing our automated sentiment predictions with the one of a group of fifteen test subjects, resulting in a satisfactory correlation.",2015,"Raghupathi, Dilip; Yannou, Bernard; Farel, Romain; Poirson, Emilie",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM,Opinion mining; Affective judgment; Customer opinion; Design inspiration; Product appraisal; Sentiment rating; User sentiment
Supporting communication between product designers and engineering designers in the design process of branded products: a comparison of three approaches,"The successful implementation of brand values and emotional concepts into physical products is critical in the design process of branded products and can be problematic when multidisciplinary project teams come from different backgrounds. This paper argues that lack of communication between product designers and engineering designers causes additional process iterations to assure that the initially intended brand values and emotional responses are preserved in the final product. This paper investigates the use of Annotations, Word Mappings and Multiple-Domain Matrices as three potential approaches to support the communication between product designers and engineering designers. The results of an evaluation study show the level of acceptability of these approaches among product designers, engineering designers and academics depending on the purpose of its use, the familiarity of users with the representation and the stage of the design process.",2014,"Rasoulifar, G; Eckert, C; Prudhomme, G",CODESIGN-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COCREATION IN DESIGN AND THE ARTS,communication; brand values; Kansei Engineering; COLLABORATION; ARTIFACTS; SYSTEM
Bibliometric and text mining approaches to evaluate landfill design standards,"In 2014, Canadians generated 961kg of waste per capita. Landfilling is a logical choice for many Canadian communities because of land availability. This paper examines and compares five different design criteria from provincial standards and guidelines in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and the Northwest Territories. Text mining including word counts, word frequency analysis, lexical quantification, and the Gunning-Fog Index are used to identify linguistic and stylistic features in the corpora. Results show that design standards and guidelines tend to be driven by climate, demographic, and environmental considerations. Rank-frequency analysis showed that the design standards were non-Zipfian (0.409<exponent<0.681), but a power relationship generally fit well (0.90<R-2<0.99). Lexical density and the Gunning-Fog Index do not consider content in figures and tables, which are key components in engineering design standards and guidelines, so a Table and Figure Factor was developed. The factor was negatively (R-2=0.735; Slope=-1.1) related to lexical density, supporting the use of tables and figures in engineering design standards and guidelines. Comparing equivalent word counts in standards to landfilling rate and landfills per capita yielded better results (Spearman R=-0.7, p=0.08) compared to government expenditure on waste management. Lexical density and Gunning-Fog Index may be good metrics when comparing landfill efficiency metrics. The study's outcomes may help to develop better landfill design standards in English speaking countries.",2019,"Richter, Amy; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Fallah, Bahareh",SCIENTOMETRICS,Bibliometric analysis and text mining; Landfill design guidelines and regulations; Lexical quantification; Radar charts; Rank-frequency relationship; Spearman rank correlation
UNO-BID: unified ontology for causal-function modeling in biologically inspired design,"In the past decades, several scientists endeavored to study and develop biomimetic solutions both for industrial and scientific purposes; nevertheless, only recently, systematic investigations of the bio-inspired design (BID) approach emerged. Even though several BID causal models appeared in engineering design literature during the last decade, none of them has still been adopted as a basis for the development of further design tools and methods. This paper aims at defining a common ontological basis for the functional-causal models by integrating the existing BID models to gain from the synergic effect of their hybridization. The thorough analysis proposed here shows the complementarity of the holistic perspective of the SAPPhIRE representation with the detailed description of system internal structure of the DANE modeling approach; moreover, the ontology of the two models do not conflict with each other and, as such, can be used as a reference to build an integrated model.",2015,"Rosa, F; Cascini, G; Baldussu, A",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION,bio-inspired design; causal model; SBF; SAPPhIRE; DANE; ENGINEERING DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; SYSTEMS
Proposal of a technical function grammar oriented to biomimetic,"Knowledge transfer from biologists to engineers is one of the main obstacles to the diffusion of biomimetic. An approach to overcome this obstacle is presented and discussed. This approach is based on a construct to describe high-level engineering functions stored in a relational database together with a species grouping based on a functional classification, the corresponding biological solutions and the 'official' taxonomy. Several relationships among the keys allow extracting and organising the stored knowledge both from the engineering and from the biological point of view. An engineer can extract from this database all the biological solutions of a function formulated in the 'engineer's language', and then determine the more suitable solution for his/her specific problem.",2011,"Rosa, F; Rovida, E; Vigano, R; Razzetti, E",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,biomimetic; technical function grammar; function representation; knowledge transfer; DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; FISH; INFORMATION; LOCOMOTION; EVOLUTION; MODEL; SKIN
A concept map to support the planning and evaluation of artifacts in the initial phases of PSS design,"Designing Product-Service Systems (PSS) is associated with multiple problems and challenges, usually derived from its multidisciplinarity and partially intangible nature. One particular issue is the high likelihood of ignoring the creation of relevant information regarding one or more PSS elements during the early design phases. Proceeding to later stages (e.g., detailed design) without generating the required information regarding all PSS elements and their relationships may lead to rework and lack of integration. Dealing with this problem requires adequate planning and evaluation of the artifacts (such as documents and models) created in the initial design phases. As a fundamental theoretical basis to support the creation of solutions that may help project managers dealing with this challenge, this paper presents a concept map to structure the concepts that compose artifacts resulting from the initial stages of PSS design and how those concepts interrelate. This concept map aims to structure which classes of information should be defined in the early phases of the design process before proceeding to a detailed design. The concept map was created by extracting concepts and relationships proposed in classifications, taxonomies, ontologies, meta-models, and concept maps in the PSS and servitization fields. Those documents were identified through a comprehensive systematic literature review. The resulting concept map was verified for completeness against formal documentation of two retrospective PSS design projects. The final proposed concept map is composed of 143 concepts interconnected through 278 relationships. In its current format, the concept map may be used as a checklist to support project managers in planning and evaluating early phases of PSS design based on information completeness. Researchers may also employ it to deploy ontologies, approach further knowledge and information-related challenges in PSS design, or structure PSS-related model-based systems engineering approaches. In future research, this concept map shall be deployed in a meta-model based on artifacts commonly used in PSS design, structuring a computational tool to allow and support practical application on planning and evaluating PSS design projects.",2021,"Rosa, Maiara; Wang, Wei Min; Stark, Rainer; Rozenfeld, Henrique",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Concept map; Evaluation; Knowledge management; Ontology; Planning; PSS design
Discovering new business opportunities with dependent semantic parsers,"How to discover new business opportunities and how to decide which ones are worth pursuing has become today an increasingly common and crucial question for the survival of many start-ups and compa-nies that now have an established technology in a saturated market. The academic world has long sought ways to support these activities in a systematic way, even though there is no reference methodology yet. In reality, there is even a lack of convergence in how to appeal to this activity, which appears under different names such as outward technology transfer, discovery of white space/technology/business opportunities. The only thing that the vast majority of searches have in common is that they all use patent databases as a source of inspiration to search for new fields of application. In line with it, this paper suggests a novel patent based approach for automatize the extraction of a list of alternative technological oppor-tunities/products. It is based on a function-based approach embedded with syntactic parsers and other natural language processing applications (NLP). They were also used to assess the different opportuni-ties and suggest which have the greatest potential for success in the market. More specifically, specific semantic patterns have been developed to control a dependent semantic parser. Thanks to this tool we can automatically analyses the content of a huge corpus of documents training the system to recognize many technological features. This paper shows mechanisms for extracting all functions provided by a given technology, the list of products that potentially can exploit such technology and a list of require-ments with which to compare products that differ in the technology used. As a result, a quantitative transfer potential index for measuring how many possibilities a given technology has of replacing an existing one is presented. Unlike many similar approaches applied to stimuli design, the method arrives at precisely suggesting the final product into which to transfer the technology and not merely suggesting a functionally related area or compatible patent class. In addition, the assessment of the replacement index is not based on distance criteria compared to the focal technology with a general purpose method, but on the contrary the judgement criteria change according to the application context. The automatic search for evaluation criteria from the specific patent content is an integral part of the method and helps to limit subjectivity in evaluations by experts in the field. However, the goodness of the results obtained is proportional to the level of knowledge of the user who interfaces to the system. Moreover, it can be universally applied to any technological context. An investigation of new application fields of heating fabrics made of carbon fiber technology is presented as exemplary case. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A Framework Based on K-Means Clustering and Topic Modeling for Analyzing Unstructured Manufacturing Capability Data,"The natural language descriptions of the capabilities of manufacturing companies can be found in multiple locations including company websites, legacy system databases, and ad hoc documents and spreadsheets. To unlock the value of unstructured capability data and learn from it, there is a need for developing advanced quantitative methods supported by machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This research proposes a hybrid unsupervised learning methodology using K-means clustering and topic modeling techniques in order to build clusters of suppliers based on their capabilities, automatically infer topics from the created clusters, and discover nontrivial patterns in manufacturing capability corpora. The capability data is extracted either directly from the website of manufacturing firms or from their profiles in e-sourcing portals and directories. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction process in this work are supported by N-gram extraction and latent semantic analysis (LSA) methods. The proposed clustering method is validated experimentally based on a dataset composed of 150 capability descriptions collected from web-based sourcing directories such as the Thomas Net directory for manufacturing companies. The results of the experiment show that the proposed method creates supplier cluster with high accuracy. Two example applications of the proposed framework, related to supplier similarity measurement and automated thesaurus creation, are introduced in this paper.",2020,"Sabbagh, R; Ameri, F",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,document clustering; text analytics; manufacturing capability; unsupervised learning; topic modeling; LDA; big data and analytics; data-driven engineering; engineering informatics; information management; knowledge engineering; machine learning for engineering applications; TEXT; VISUALIZATION; EXTRACTION
Thesaurus-Guided Text Analytics Technique for Capability-Based Classification of Manufacturing Suppliers,"Manufacturing capability (MC) analysis is a necessary step in the early stages of supply chain formation. In the contract manufacturing industry, companies often advertise their capabilities and services in an unstructured format on the company website. The unstructured capability data usually portray a realistic view of the services a supplier can offer. If parsed and analyzed properly, unstructured capability data can be used effectively for initial screening and characterization of manufacturing suppliers specially when dealing with a large pool of suppliers. This work proposes a novel framework for capability-based supplier classification that relies on the unstructured capability narratives available on the suppliers' websites. Four document classification algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) are used as the text classification techniques. One of the innovative aspects of this work is incorporating a thesaurus-guided method for feature selection and tokenization of capability data. The thesaurus contains the formal and informal vocabulary used in the contract machining industry for advertising manufacturing capabilities. A web-based tool is developed for the generation of the concept vector model associated with each capability narrative and extraction of features from the input documents. The proposed supplier classification framework is validated experimentally through forming two capability classes, namely, heavy component machining and difficult and complex machining, based on real capability data. It was concluded that thesaurus-guided method improves the precision of the classification process.",2018,"Sabbagh, R; Ameri, F; Yoder, R",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; PRODUCT; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT
Adapting ADA Architectural Design Knowledge for Universal Product Design Using Association Rule Mining: A Function Based Approach,"This paper focuses on creating guidelines for the design of products for persons with disabilities that are applicable during early stages of design. The research uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to formally describe user activity, the Functional Basis to describe product function, and the actionfunction diagram as a framework to create a detailed understanding of the interaction between a user and a product. The main objective of this paper is to explore the transferability of the knowledge contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to universal product design. The design information contained in the ADA guidelines is abstracted using a function based approach; association rules are mined from this design information. The association rules obtained are statistically significant guidelines for universal design (UD). The existing examples of universal design are compared to their typical version to observe the design elements that improve the accessibility of a product. Association rules are also mined from the existing examples of universal design using the same methodology. Further, the applicability of ADA guidelines to universal product design is investigated based on the commonality between the association rules obtained from both the datasets. The results show that rules can be translated to a product having a degree of similarity based on the size and space relationship between the user and product without direct translation from an ADA based design guideline to a product design guideline.",2012,"Sangelkar, S; McAdams, DA",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; MODEL
TechNet: Technology semantic network based on patent data,"The growing developments in general semantic networks, knowledge graphs and ontology databases have motivated us to build a large-scale comprehensive semantic network of technology-related data for engineering knowledge discovery, technology search and retrieval, and artificial intelligence for engineering design and innovation. Specially, we constructed a technology semantic network (TechNet) that covers the elemental concepts in all domains of technology and their semantic associations by mining the complete U.S. patent database from 1976. To derive the TechNet, natural language processing techniques were utilized to extract terms from massive patent texts and recent word embedding algorithms were employed to vectorize such terms and establish their semantic relationships. We report and evaluate the TechNet for retrieving terms and their pairwise relevance that is meaningful from a technology and engineering design perspective. The TechNet may serve as an infrastructure to support a wide range of applications, e.g., technical text summaries, search query predictions, relational knowledge discovery, and design ideation support, in the context of engineering and technology, and complement or enrich existing semantic databases. To enable such applications, the TechNet is made public via an online interface and APIs for public users to retrieve technology-related terms and their relevancies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A representation language for behavior and function: FBRL,"Although a lot of researchers have pointed out the significance of functional representation, the general relations between function and behavior are not yet fully understood. We consider the knowledge of each component in a system as consisting of two elements. One is a necessary and sufficient concept for simulation of the component which we call the behavior model. The other is the interpretation of the behavior under a desirable state which the component is expected to achieve, which we call function. By classification of the primitives necessary for the interpretation of the behavior in various domains, which we call `'domain ontology”, we can capture and represent the function by selection and combination of the primitives. This paper proposes FBRL, a new language for representing behavior and function by combining the primitive we identified. Also we investigate the relation between function and behavior based on the primitives. As the primitives can represent concepts at various levels of abstraction, they will contribute to those task which rely on the simulations on the model of the target object, such as diagnosis, design, explanation and so on.

Do word graphs stimulate design?,"In the early phase of the architectural design process the architect makes his ideas explicit in the design draft by means of a variety of representations such as sketches, marks, images, and annotations. So far, annotations have not seen much research attention, although they do reveal part of the design content. In this article we study the effects of offering feedback to annotations, namely by presenting word graphs that contain the architect's annotations and semantic associations based oil these words. Our aim is to investigate whether the feedback in word graphs can stimulate design. The research method entails a working prototype, called the Idea Space System (ISS), in an experimental setting in it which 18 architects participated. ISS searches for semantic relations between single words (annotations) and for intermediary words. The findings of the experiment show that architects appreciate the use of word graphs. They experience pleasure, an improvement of the workflow, and especially get more associations while using the ISS with feedback in word graphs. Nevertheless, we cannot find a significant increased creativity of the resulting designs, or a significant reduction of fixation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A Formal Representation of Function Structure Graphs for Physics-Based Reasoning,"The paper presents a formal representation for modeling function structure graphs in a consistent, grammatically controlled manner, and for performing conservation-based formal reasoning on those models. The representation consists of a hierarchical vocabulary of entities, relations, and attributes, and 33 local grammar rules that permit or prohibit modeling constructs thereby ensuring model consistency. Internal representational consistency is verified by committing the representation to a Protege web ontology language ( OWL) ontology and examining it with the Pellet consistency checker. External representational validity is established by implementing the representation in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool and using it to demonstrate that the grammar rules prohibit inconsistent constructs and that the models support physics-based reasoning based on the balance laws of transport phenomena. This representation, including the controlled grammar, can serve, in the future, as a basis for additional reasoning extensions.",2013,"Sen, Chiradeep; Summers, Joshua D.; Mocko, Gregory M.",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,reasoning; formal representation; function structure; grammar; vocabulary
Organizing Tagged Knowledge: Similarity Measures and Semantic Fluency in Structure Mining,"Recovering a system's underlying structure from its historical records (also called structure mining) is essential to making valid inferences about that system's behavior. For example, making reliable predictions about system failures based on maintenance work order data requires determining how concepts described within the work order are related. Obtaining such structural information is challenging, requiring system understanding, synthesis, and representation design. This is often either too difficult or too time consuming to produce. Consequently, a common approach to quickly elicit tacit structural knowledge from experts is to gather uncontrolled keywords as record labels-i.e., tags. One can then map those tags to concepts within the structure and quantitatively infer relationships between them. Existing models of tag similarity tend to either depend on correlation strength (e.g., overall co-occurrence frequencies) or on conditional strength (e.g., tag sequence probabilities). A key difficulty in applying either model is understanding under what conditions one is better than the other for overall structure recovery. In this paper, we investigate the core assumptions and implications of these two classes of similarity measures on structure recovery tasks. Then, using lessons from this characterization, we borrow from recent psychology literature on semantic fluency tasks to construct a tag similarity measure that emulates how humans recall tags from memory. We show through empirical testing that this method combines strengths of both common modeling paradigms. We also demonstrate its potential as a preprocessor for structure mining tasks via a case study in semi-supervised learning on real excavator maintenance work orders.",2020,"Sexton, T; Fuge, M",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,cognitive-based design; expert systems; machine learning; systems engineering; 
A Data-Driven Text Mining and Semantic Network Analysis for Design Information Retrieval,"With the advent of the big-data era, massive information stored in electronic and digital forms on the internet become valuable resources for knowledge discovery in engineering design. Traditional document retrieval method based on document indexing focuses on retrieving individual documents related to the query, but is incapable of discovering the various associations between individual knowledge concepts. Ontology-based technologies, which can extract the inherent relationships between concepts by using advanced text mining tools, can be applied to improve design information retrieval in the large-scale unstructured textual data environment. However, few of the public available ontology database stands on a design and engineering perspective to establish the relations between knowledge concepts. This paper develops a WordNet focusing on design and engineering associations by integrating the text mining approaches to construct an unsupervised learning ontology network. Subsequent probability and velocity network analysis are applied with different statistical behaviors to evaluate the correlation degree between concepts for design information retrieval. The validation results show that the probability and velocity analysis on our constructed ontology network can help recognize the high related complex design and engineering associations between elements. Finally, an engineering design case study demonstrates the use of our constructed semantic network in real-world project for design relations retrieval.",2017,"Shi, F; Chen, LQ; Han, J; Childs, P",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; ONTOLOGY; SEARCH; REPRESENTATIONS; METHODOLOGY; CHALLENGES; EXTRACTION; SYSTEMS; FUTURE
Enhanced customer requirement classification for product design using big data and improved Kano model,"The classification of customer requirements (CRs) has a significant impact on the solution of product design. Existing CRs classification methods such as the Kano model and IPA model are time-consuming and inaccurate. This paper proposes a CRs classification method for product design using big data of online customer reviews of products to classify CRs accurately and efficiently. Comments of customer reviews are matched to CRs using a hierarchical semantic similarity method. Customer satisfaction degrees are defined based on emotional levels of adjectives and adverbs of customer comments using word vectors. The function implementation degree of each product is determined by specifications crawled from online products. Fitting curves are formed by defined customer satisfaction and function implementation of CRs using polynomial modeling and least square methods. Based on the slope of the fitted curves, CRs are classified to provide the minimum and maximum function implementations of CRs in each CR group to guide a product design process. The proposed method is applied in a case study of defining CRs classifications for design of upper limb rehabilitation devices. For verifying the proposed method, CRs defined by the existing methods are compared with CRs from the proposed method in design of an upper limb rehabilitation device.",2021,"Shi, Yanlin; Peng, Qingjin",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Big data; Product design; Customer requirements; Function implementation; Kano model
A natural-language approach to biomimetic design,"This paper summarizes various aspects of identifying and applying biological analogies in engineering design using a natural-language approach. To avoid the immense as well as potentially biased task of creating a biological database specifically for engineering design, the chosen approach searches biological knowledge in natural-language format, such as books and papers, for instances of keywords describing the engineering problem. Strategies developed to facilitate this search are identified, and how text descriptions of biological phenomena are used in problem solving is summarized. Several application case studies are reported to illustrate the approach. The value of the natural-language approach is demonstrated by its ability to identify relevant biological analogies that are not limited to those entered into a database specifically for engineering design.",2010,"Shu, LH",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Analogical Reasoning; Biologically Inspired Design; Biomimetic Design; Design By Analogy; Natural-Language Approach; REMANUFACTURE
Three methods for identifying novel affordances,"We describe three approaches to identify novel product affordances: affordance of absence; insights from lead users, specifically do-it-yourselfers (DIYers); and natural-language searches. While these approaches were separately pursued, we show their connection to each other in this paper. We begin by describing the affordance of absence, inspired by insights on affordances arising from a lack of resources. For example, in the absence of specialized tools, more general tools are used to accomplish similar tasks. Such absence clarifies how other tools could be modified to add relevant features and identifies critical features of the absent tool. In addition, the temporary removal of physical features and objects enables user interaction in ways that may not emerge in their presence. Affordance of absence has the potential to more fully specify affordances for a given object and to help overcome functional fixedness. For the second approach, we describe insights from DIYers obtained from the IKEA hackers online community. We consider DIYers lead users for seeking out and exploiting product affordances, often transforming product functions dramatically. We also discuss their projects through the lens of affordance of absence. For the third approach, we outline our natural-language approach to affordance extraction, beginning with consumer product reviews provided for Canadian Tire, a major Canadian retailer. We describe efforts toward automatically identifying less common affordances, and the use of cue phrases to highlight insightful DIY transformations from the IKEA hackers community. Finally, we comment on the potential value of this work for product design in general.",2015,"Shu, LH; Srivastava, J; Chou, A; Lai, S",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Absence; Affordance; Lead Users; Natural-Language Search; Novelty; DESIGN
Evaluating the impact of Idea-Inspire 4.0 on analogical transfer of concepts,"The biological domain has the potential to offer a rich source of analogies to solve engineering design problems. However, due to the complexity embedded in biological systems, adding to the lack of structured, detailed, and searchable knowledge bases, engineering designers find it hard to access the knowledge in the biological domain, which therefore poses challenges in understanding the biological concepts in order to apply these concepts to engineering design problems. In order to assist the engineering designers in problem-solving, we report, in this paper, a web-based tool called Idea-Inspire 4.0 that supports analogical design using two broad features. First, the tool provides access to a number of biological systems using a searchable knowledge base. Second, it explains each one of these biological systems using a multi-modal representation: that is, using function decomposition model, text, function model, image, video, and audio. In this paper, we report two experiments that test how well the multi-modal representation in Idea-Inspire 4.0 supports understanding and application of biological concepts in engineering design problems. In one experiment, we use Bloom's method to test analysis and synthesis levels of understanding of a biological system. In the next experiment, we provide an engineering design problem along with a biological-analogous system and examine the novelty and requirement-satisfaction (two major indicators of creativity) of resulting design solutions. In both the experiments, the biological system (analogue) was provided using Idea-Inspire 4.0 as well as using a conventional text-image representation so that the efficacy of Idea-Inspire 4.0 is tested using a benchmark.",2018,"Siddharth, L; Chakrabarti, A",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Analogical and bio-inspired design; creativity and ideation; novelty; requirement-satisfaction; understanding; DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; GENERATION; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION; CREATIVITY; SYSTEMS
Toward Automatically Assessing the Novelty of Engineering Design Solutions,"We propose to automate the assessment of novelty during the early design stages, where the number of solution alternatives is high, and these alternatives are flexible. The novelty of a solution is measured as its distance from a reference product database. The distance is calculated by comparing the solution and a reference at different levels of abstraction, as defined by a casuality model called SAPPhIRE. The fundamental instrument of this comparison is a text similarity metric, which is integrated with the novelty score, a support for which is developed as an Android application, named IdeA-Novelty. The application of the algorithm upon 20 solutions reveals that the measurement is computationally expensive. The expert's ratings for the same solution set seem to vary drastically. We take this observation as the basis for an extensive discussion on novelty, an operational definition for which is proposed toward the end.",2020,"Siddharth, L; Madhusudanan, N; Chakrabarti, A",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,artificial intelligence; computational synthesis; computer-aided design; data-driven engineering; engineering informatics; information management; knowledge engineering; SEMANTIC SIMILARITY; CREATIVITY; METHODOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGY; METRICS
"A machine learning approach to product review disambiguation based on function, form and behavior classification","Online product reviews have been shown to be a viable source of information for helping customers make informed purchasing decisions. In many cases, users of online shopping platforms have the ability to rate products on a numerical scale, and also provide textual feedback pertaining to a purchased product Beyond using online product review platforms as customer decision support systems, this information rich data source could also aid designers seeking to increase the chances of their products being successful in the market through a deeper understanding of market needs. However, the increasing size and complexity of products on the market makes manual analysis of such data challenging. Information obtained from such sources, if not mined correctly, risks misrepresenting a product's true success/failure (e.g., a customer leaves a one star rating because of the slow shipping service of a product, not necessarily that he/she dislikes the product). The objective of this paper is three fold: i) to propose a machine learning approach that disambiguates online customer review feedback by classifying them into one of three direct product characteristics (i.e., form, function or behavior) and two indirect product characteristics (i.e., service and other), ii) to discover the machine learning algorithm that yields the highest and most generalizable results in achieving objective i) and iii) to quantify the correlation between product ratings and direct and indirect product characteristics. A case study involving review data for products mined from e-commerce websites is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A multilayered (i.e., k-fold and leave one out) validation approach is presented to explore the generalizability of the proposed method. The resulting machine learning model achieved classification accuracies of 82.44% for within product classification, 80.84% for across product classification, 79.03% for across product type classification and 80.64% for across product domain classification. Furthermore, it was determined that the form of a product had the highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient relating to a product's star rating, with a value of 0.934. The scientific contributions of this work have the potential to transform the manner in which both product designers and customers incorporate product reviews into their decision making processes by quantifying the relationship between product reviews and product characteristics.

Development of a service evolution map for service design through application of text mining to service documents,"As digital convergence has proliferated and products have become smarter, various service concepts have emerged based on the capabilities of products. It has become a main concern to illuminate historical changes and status of service concepts according to the utilisation of product elements to provide valuable information for service development. However, a lacuna still remains in the literature regarding a systematic and quantitative approach on this problem. This study proposes a service evolution map as a tool for analysing the evolutionary paths of service concepts based on the utilisation of product elements. The proposed service evolution map consists of two layers with the time dimension: a product element layer for the utilisation of product elements and a service concept layer for the evolutionary paths of service concepts. Based on the service documents describing what the services are, text mining, co-word analysis, and modified formal concept analysis are employed to develop the product element and service concept layers, respectively. A case study of mobile application services is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. This study is expected to be a basis of future research on the interaction between products and services and service concept design based on the creative utilisation of product elements.",2017,"Song, B; Yoon, B; Lee, C; Park, Y",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Service evolution map; Text mining; Co-word analysis; Formal concept analysis; Service documents; BUSINESS SERVICES; PRODUCT; TECHNOLOGY; INFORMATION; INTELLIGENCE; INNOVATION
"Design-by-Analogy: Exploring for Analogical Inspiration With Behavior, Material, and Component-Based Structural Representation of Patent Databases","Design-by-analogy (DbA) is an important method for innovation that has gained much attention due to its history of leading to successful and novel design solutions. The method uses a repository of existing design solutions where designers can recognize and retrieve analogical inspirations. Yet, exploring for analogical inspiration has been a laborious task for designers. This work presents a computational methodology that is driven by a topic modeling technique called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is widely used in the text mining field for its ability to discover topics within documents based on their semantic content. In the proposed methodology, NMF is performed iteratively to build hierarchical repositories of design solutions, with which designers can explore clusters of analogical stimuli. This methodology has been applied to a repository of mechanical design-related patents, processed to contain only component-, behavior-, or material-based content to test if unique and valuable attribute-based analogical inspiration can be discovered from the different representations of patent data. The hierarchical repositories have been visualized, and a case study has been conducted to test the effectiveness of the analogical retrieval process of the proposed methodology. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the exploration-based computational methodology may provide designers an enhanced control over design repositories to retrieve analogical inspiration for DbA practice.",2019,"Song, Hyeonik; Fu, Katherine",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,;
Deep learning-based extraction of predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences,"This paper describes an approach to extracting a predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models. For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements. The proposed approach contributes to broadening the scope of building information modeling-enabled rule checking to any natural language-based design requirements.",2020,"Song, Jaeyeol; Lee, Jin-Kook; Choi, Jungsik; Kim, Inhan",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING,automated rule checking; building information modeling (BIM); natural language processing (NLP); predicate argument structure
A comparative study of abstractive and extractive summarization techniques to label subgroups on patent dataset,"Patents are an important source of information for measuring the technological advancement of a specific knowledge domain. To facilitate the search for information in patent datasets, classification systems separate documents into groups according to the area of knowledge, and designate names to define their content. The increase in the number of patented inventions leads to the need to subdivide these groups. Since these groups belong to a restricted knowledge domain, naming the generated subcategories can be extremely laborious. This work aims to compare the performance of abstractive and extractive summarization techniques in the task of generating sentences directly associated with the content of patents. The abstractive summarization model was composed by a Seq2Seq architecture and a LSTM network. The training was conducted with a dataset of patent titles and abstracts. The validation process was performed using the ROUGE set of metrics. The results obtained by the generated model were compared with the sentence resulting from an extractive summarization algorithm applied to the task of naming patent groups. The main idea was to help the specialist to name new patent groups created by the clustering systems. The naming experiments were performed on the dataset of abstracts of patent documents.

A study on the grammatical construction of function structures,"Function structures are used during conceptual engineering design to transform the customer requirements into specific functional tasks. Although they are usually constructed from a well-understood black-box description of an artifact, there is no clear approach or formal set of rules that guide the creation of function structures. To remedy the unclear formation of such structures and to provide the potential for automated reasoning of such structures, a graph grammar is developed and implemented. The grammar can be used by a designer to explore various solutions to a conceptual design problem. Furthermore, the grammar aids in disseminating engineering functional information and in teaching the function structure concept to untrained engineers. Thirty products are examined as a basis for developing the grammar rules, and the rules are implemented in an interactive user environment.

The set of functions and flows is intended to comprehensively describe the mechanical design space. Clear definitions are provided for each function and flow. The functional basis is compared to previous functional representations and is shown to subsume these attempts as well as offer a more consistent classification scheme.

However, since customer requirements change dynamically over time, traditional studies failed to obtain the change data of customer requirements and opinions based on sentiments expressed in reviews. In this paper, a new method for dynamically mining user requirements is proposed, which is used to analyze the changing behavior of product attributes and improve product design. Dynamic mining differs from the traditional need acquisition mainly in three aspects: (1) it involves dynamically mining user requirements over time (2) it adds changes in manufacturers' opinions to the analysis (3) it allows for product improvement strategies based on the changing behavior of product attributes. First, text mining is adopted to collect customer and manufacturer review data for different time periods and extract product attributes. A Natural Language Processing tool is used to measure the importance weight and sentiment score of product attributes. Second, an approach for dynamically mining user requirements is introduced to classify product attributes and analyze the changes of attribute data in three categories over time. Finally, an improvement strategy for next-generation product design is developed based on the changing behavior of attributes. Moreover, a case study on vehicles based on online reviews was conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology. Our research suggests that the proposed approach can accurately mine customer requirements and lead to successful product improvement strategies for next-generation products.",2020,"Sun, Hui; Guo, Wei; Shao, Hongyu; Rong, Bo",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Online reviews; Dynamic changes; Product improvement; Requirement mining
Exploring eWOM in online customer reviews: Sentiment analysis at a fine-grained level,"Customer reviews in social media and electronic commerce Web sites contain valuable electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) information of products, which facilitates firms' business strategy and individual consumers' comparison shopping. Exploring eWOM of products embedded in customer reviews has attracted interest from researchers in various fields. Coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches have been used in existing researches, which however often fail to satisfy the firms' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence from social media. In this study, we propose an original method to explore eWOM of products based on sentiment analysis at fine-grained level from a large volume of online customer reviews. We illustrate a feature-based and context-sensitive sentiment analysis mechanism that can leverage the sheer volume of customer reviews in social media sites. A novel semi-supervised fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm is proposed to extract semantic knowledge from online customer reviews with positive or negative labels. Based on real-world online customer review data set, the proposed method shows remarkable performance improvement over baseline methods at exploring eWOM of product a fine-grained level. With the novel eWOM exploring method, firms can improve their product design and marketing strategies, and potential consumers can make better online purchase decisions.",2019,"Sun, Qing; Niu, Jianwei; Yao, Zhong; Yan, Hao",ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,Sentiment analysis; eWOM; Fuzzy product ontology
A Systematic Methodology Based on Word Embedding for Identifying the Relation Between Online Customer Reviews and Sales Rank,"In the buying decision process, online reviews become an important source of information. They become the basis of evaluating alternatives before making purchase decision. This paper proposes a methodology to reveal one of the hidden alternative evaluation processes by identifying the relation between the observable online customer reviews and sales rank. This methodology applies a combined approach of word embedding (word2vec) and X-means clustering, which produces product-feature words. It is followed by identifying sentiment words and their intensity, determining connection of words from dependency tree, and finally relating variables from the reviews to the sales rank of a product by a regression model. The methodology is applied to two data sets of wearable technology and laptop products. As implied by the high predicted R-squared values, the models are generalizable into new data sets. Among the interesting findings are the statements of problems or issues of a product are related to better sales rank, and many product features that are mentioned in the review title are significantly related to sales rank. For product designers, the significant variables in the regression models suggest the possible product features to be improved.",2018,"Suryadi, D; Kim, H",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; PRODUCT FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CONSUMER REVIEWS; OPINION
A Data-Driven Approach to Product Usage Context Identification From Online Customer Reviews,"This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automatically identify product usage contexts from online customer reviews. Product usage context is one of the factors that affect product design, consumer behavior, and consumer satisfaction. The previous works identify the usage contexts using the survey-based method or subjectively determine them. The proposed methodology, on the other hand, uses machine learning and Natural Language Processing tools to identify and cluster usage contexts from a large volume of customer reviews. Furthermore, aspect sentiment analysis is applied to capture the sentiment toward a particular usage context in a sentence. The methodology is implemented to two data sets of products, i.e., laptop and tablet. The result shows that the methodology is able to capture relevant product usage contexts and cluster bigrams that refer to similar usage context. The aspect sentiment analysis enables the observation of a product's position with respect to its competitors for a particular usage context. For a product designer, the observation may indicate a requirement to improve the product. It may also indicate a possible market opportunity in a usage context in which most of the current products are perceived negatively by customers. Finally, it is shown that overall rating might not be a strong indicator for representing customer sentiment toward a particular usage context, due to the moderate linear correlation for most of the usage contexts in the case study.",2019,"Suryadi, D; Kim, HM",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,design methodology; usage context; Natural Language Processing; customer reviews; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Semantic Modelling of Engineering Designs,"The entity-relationship (E-R) approach is a widely used technique for the semantic modelling of commercial database systems. This paper demonstrates that the ER method can also be applied in the modelling of static design knowledge for knowledge-based engineering design systems. It presents the basic definitions of the E-R data modelling method and describes some extensions which are useful to model the functionality of system components. It demonstrates the use of this method to produce a generic model of a centrifugal hydraulic pump, which is being used in the implementation of an object-oriented intelligent CAD system. Finally, conclusions on the suitability of the entity-relationship for engineering knowledge representation are drawn.",1993,"Taleb-Bendiab, A; Oh, V; Sommerville, I; French, M",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,; 
"Integrating Topic, Sentiment, and Syntax for Modeling Online Reviews: A Topic Model Approach","Analyzing product online reviews has drawn much interest in the academic field. In this research, a new probabilistic topic model, called tag sentiment aspect models (TSA), is proposed on the basis of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which aims to reveal latent aspects and corresponding sentiment in a review simultaneously. Unlike other topic models which consider words in online reviews only, syntax tags are taken as visual information and, in this research, as a kind of widely used syntax information, part-of-speech (POS) tags are first reckoned. Specifically, POS tags are integrated into three versions of implementation in consideration of the fact that words with different POS tags might be utilized to express consumers' opinions. Also, the proposed TSA is one unsupervised approach and only a small number of positive and negative words are required to confine different priors for training. Finally, two big datasets regarding digital SLR and laptop are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in terms of sentiment classification and aspect extraction. Comparative experiments show that the new model can not only achieve promising results on sentiment classification but also leverage the performance on aspect extraction.",2019,"Tang, M; Jin, J; Liu, Y; Li, CP; Zhang, WW",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,topic model; sentiment analysis; tag sentiment aspect; online review analysis; opinion mining; PRODUCT REVIEWS; SPEECH; TAGGER
Natural language processing for aviation safety reports: From classification to interactive analysis,"In this paper we describe the different NLP techniques designed and used in collaboration between the CLLE-ERSS research laboratory and the CFH/Safety Data company to manage and analyse aviation incident reports. These reports are written every time anything abnormal occurs during a civil air flight. Although most of them relate routine problems, they are a valuable source of information about possible sources of greater danger. These texts are written in plain language, show a wide range of linguistic variation (telegraphic style overcrowded by acronyms or standard prose) and exist in different languages, even for a single company/country (although our main focus is on English and French). In addition to their variety, their sheer quantity (e.g. 600/month for a large airline company) clearly requires the use of advanced NLP and text mining techniques in order to extract useful information from them. Although this context and objectives seem to indicate that standard NLP techniques can be applied in a straightforward manner, innovative techniques are required to handle the specifics of aviation report text and the complex classification systems. We present several tools that aim at a better access to this data (classification and information retrieval), and help aviation safety experts in their analyses (data text mining and interactive analysis). Some of these tools are currently in test or in use both at the national and international levels, by airline companies as well as by regulation authorities (DGAC,(1) EASA,(2) ICAO(3)).

A knowledge centric methodology for dental implant technology assessment using ontology based patent analysis and clinical meta-analysis,"The medical equipment industry has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the decade with predicted global sales reaching US$ 430 billion in 2017 [22]. During the period from 1995 to 2008, the patent applications in medical technology increased rapidly worldwide (World Intellectual Property Organization, 2012). Patent analysis, although useful in forecasting technology development trends, has posed a challenging analysis task since the volume and diversity of new patent applications has surpassed the ability of regular firms and research teams to process and identify relevant information. Further, medical related technologies rely on clinical trials to validate and gain regulatory approval for patient treatment even though patents, protecting the intellectual property rights of inventors, have been granted. This research focuses on developing a knowledge centric methodology and system to analyze and assess viable medical technology innovations and trends considering both patents and clinical reports. Specifically, the design innovations of dental implant connections are used as a case study. A novel and generic methodology combining ontology based patent analysis and clinical meta-analysis is developed to analyze and identify the most effective patented techniques in the dental implant field. The research establishes and verifies a computer supported analytical approach and system for the strategic prediction of medical technology development trends. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Automated Discovery of Product Feature Inferences Within Large-Scale Implicit Social Media Data,"Recently, social media has emerged as an alternative, viable source to extract large-scale, heterogeneous product features in a time and cost-efficient manner. One of the challenges of utilizing social media data to inform product design decisions is the existence of implicit data such as sarcasm, which accounts for 22.75% of social media data, and can potentially create bias in the predictive models that learn from such data sources. For example, if a customer says I just love waiting all day while this song downloads, an automated product feature extraction model may incorrectly associate a positive sentiment of love to the cell phone's ability to download. While traditional text mining techniques are designed to handle well-formed text where product features are explicitly inferred from the combination of words, these tools would fail to process these social messages that include implicit product feature information. In this paper, we propose a method that enables designers to utilize implicit social media data by translating each implicit message into its equivalent explicit form, using the word concurrence network. A case study of Twitter messages that discuss smartphone features is used to validate the proposed method. The results from the experiment not only show that the proposed method improves the interpretability of implicit messages, but also sheds light on potential applications in the design domains where this work could be extended.",2018,"Tuarob, S; Lim, S; Tucker, CS",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; METHODOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE
Quantifying Product Favorability and Extracting Notable Product Features Using Large Scale Social Media Data,"Some of the challenges that designers face in getting broad external input from customers during and after product launch include geographic limitations and the need for physical interaction with the design artifact(s). Having to conduct such user-based studies would require huge amounts of time and financial resources. In the past decade, social media has emerged as an increasingly important medium of communication and information sharing. Being able to mine and harness product-relevant knowledge within such a massive, readily accessible collection of data would give designers an alternative way to learn customers' preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner. In this paper, we propose a data mining driven methodology that identifies product features and associated customer opinions favorably received in the market space which can then be integrated into the design of next generation products. Two unique product domains (smartphones and automobiles) are investigated to validate the proposed methodology and establish social media data as a viable source of large scale, heterogeneous data relevant to next generation product design and development. We demonstrate in our case studies that incorporating suggested features into next generation products can result in favorable sentiment from social media users.",2015,"Tuarob, S; Tucker, CS",JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING,; WORD-OF-MOUTH; CONSUMERS; NETWORKS
Analysing frequent natural language expressions from design conversations,"This paper extracts and analyses the most frequent natural language expressions used by participants in two real-world collaborative design sessions. The frequent expressions are extracted using the natural language processing technique of word sequence tokenisation. We then select a set of frequent expressions related to design changes. The boundaries of these are expanded by extracting the progression trends to identify specific speaker intents. These are analysed in detail while focusing on ambiguity and vagueness, aiming at identifying speakers' precision when communicating design changes. We found that frequently used expressions play the role of language markers. In our discussion, we suggest that ambiguous and vague expressions used by participants can initiate mindful explorations of design space. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A scalable approach for ideation in biologically inspired design,"This paper presents a bioinspiration approach that is able to scalably leverage the ever-growing body of biological information in natural-language format. The ideation tool AskNature, developed by the Biomimicry 3.8 Institute, is expanded with an algorithm for automated classification of biological strategies into the Biomimicry Taxonomy, a three-level, hierarchical information structure that organizes AskNature's database. In this way, the manual work entailed by the classification of biological strategies can be alleviated. Thus, the bottleneck is removed that currently prevents the integration of large numbers of biological strategies. To demonstrate the feasibility of building a scalable bioideation system, this paper presents tests that classify biological strategies from AskNature's reference database for those Biomimicry Taxonomy classes that currently hold sufficient reference documents.",2015,"Vandevenne, D; Verhaegen, PA; Dewulf, S; Duflou, JR",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Bioinspired Design; Biomimicry; Creativity and Ideation; 
SEABIRD: Scalable search for systematic biologically inspired design,"As more and more people are increasingly turning to nature for design inspiration, tools and methodologies are developed to support the systematic bioideation process. State-of-the-art approaches struggle with expanding their knowledge bases because of interactive work required by humans per biological strategy. As an answer to this persistent challenge, a scalable search for systematic biologically inspired design (SEABIRD) system is proposed. This system leverages experience from the product aspects in design by analogy tool that identifies candidate products for between-domain design by analogy. SEABIRD is based on two conceptual representations, product and organism aspects, extracted from, respectively, a patent and a biological database, that enable leveraging the ever growing body of natural-language biological texts in the systematic bioinspired design process by eliminating interactive work by humans during corpus expansion. SEABIRD's search is illustrated and validated with three well-known biologically inspired design cases.",2016,"Vandevenne, D; Verhaegen, PA; Dewulf, S; Duflou, JR",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Bioinspired Design; Biologically Inspired Design; Biomimicry; Creativity and Ideation; BIOMIMETIC DESIGN; REPRESENTATION
QuenchML: A semantics-preserving markup language for knowledge representation in quenching,"Knowledge representation (KR) is an important area in artificial intelligence (AI) and is often related to specific domains. The representation of knowledge in domain-specific contexts makes it desirable to capture semantics as domain experts would. This motivates the development of semantics-preserving standards for KR within the given domain. In addition to the storage and analysis of information using such standards, the effect of globalization today necessitates the publishing of information on the Web. Thus, it is advisable to use formats that make the information easily publishable and accessible while developing KR standards. In this article, we propose such a standard called Quenching Markup Language (QuenchML). This follows the syntax of the eXtensible Markup Language and captures the semantics of the quenching domain within the heat treating of materials. We describe the development of QuenchML, a multidisciplinary effort spanning the realms of AI, database management, and materials science, considering various aspects such as ontology, data modeling, and domain-specific constraints. We also explain the usefulness of QuenchML in semantics-preserving information retrieval and in text mining guided by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we outline the significance of this work in software tools within the field of AI.",2013,"Varde, AS; Maniruzzaman, M; Sisson, RD",AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING,Domain Expertise; Heat Treating of Materials; Information Retrieval; Semantic Web; Text Mining; XML; DESIGN; WEB
Kansei engineering as a tool for the design of in-vehicle rubber keypads,"Manufacturers are currently adopting a consumer-centered philosophy which poses the challenge of developing differentiating products in a context of constant innovation and competitiveness. To merge both function and experience in a product, it is necessary to understand customers' experience when interacting with interfaces. This paper describes the use of Kansei methodology as a tool to evaluate the subjective perception of rubber keypads. Participants evaluated eleven rubber keys with different values of force, stroke and snap ratio, according to seven Kansei words ranging from “pleasantness” to “click-Mess”. Evaluation data was collected using the semantic differential technique and compared with data from the physical properties of the keys. Kansei proved to be a robust method to evaluate the qualitative traits of products, and a new physical parameter for the tactile feel of “clickiness” is suggested, having obtained better results than the commonly used Snap Ratio. It was possible to establish very strong relations between Kansei words and all physical properties. This approach will result in guidance to the industry for the design of in-vehicle rubber keypads with user-centered concerns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A decision-making method for complex system design in a heterogeneous language information environment,"In the process of designing engineering systems, early system design often plays an important role. Although the existing system design methods are very effective, the preference information of different experts and the uncertainty of their subjective preferences are not processed effectively. Because different stakeholders have different backgrounds and different personalities, their linguistics preferences are expressed differently. Therefore, it is difficult to select a system scheme that meets all the performance requirements and is approved by various stakeholders. To solve this problem, a decision-making method is proposed in this study for complex system design in a heterogeneous language information environment. First, a theoretical system scheme set is constructed through a morphological matrix, and a multi-objective programming model is constructed based on the performance indicators to select the system scheme set that optimises each performance objective and meets the performance constraints. Then, a trapezoidal asymmetric cloud model is used as an intermediary for containing heterogeneous language information to integrate each stakeholder's preference information, as expressed by their favourite linguistic term sets, and to select the best system solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a system design example of a horizontal directional drilling machine.",2021,"Wang, G; Wu, LJ; Liu, YS; Ye, XP",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Heterogeneous language information; linguistic term set; system design; cloud model; decision making; 
A two-level parser for patent claim parsing,"Patent claim parsing can contribute in many patent-related applications, such as patent search, information extraction, machine translation and summarization. However, patent claim parsing is difficult due to the special structure of patent claims. To overcome this difficulty, the challenges facing the patent claim parsing were first investigated and the peculiarities of claim syntax that obstruct dependency parsing were highlighted. To handle these peculiarities, this study proposes a new two-level parser, in which a conventional parser is imbedded. A patent claim is pre-processed in order to remove peculiarities before passed to the conventional parser. The process is based on a new dependency-based syntax called Independent Claim Segment Dependency Syntax (ICSDS). This two-lever parser has demonstrated promising improvement for patent claim parsing on both effectiveness and efficiency over the conventional parser. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge acquisition method from domain text based on theme logic model and artificial neural network,"In order to acquire knowledge from domain text such as failure analysis text of aviation product, a framework is proposed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge acquisition. In this framework, sentence templates are defined to extract the meta-knowledge and RDF is used to describe the extracted knowledge. After the preprocessing steps, the authors propose a new model: theme logic model (TLM) to present all the themes of a piece of text and the logical relations among different themes. In this model, the text of each theme can be represented as an attribute-value vector based on domain ontology. Meanwhile, the logical relations are the domain knowledge to be acquired. The theme logic model then will be transformed to the training set of the artificial neural network to acquire the failure analysis knowledge. After training process, acquired knowledge will be extracted by SD method from the artificial neural network and represented by rules. Therefore. a prototype is developed to acquire knowledge from failure analysis reports of aviation product. Empirical results show that the framework can acquire knowledge from domain text efficiently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A hybrid Kansei engineering design expert system based on grey system theory and support vector regression,"Nowadays customers choose products strictly in terms of their specific demands. How to quickly and accurately catch customers' feelings and transform them into design elements and vice versa becomes an important issue. This study explores the bi-directional relationship between customers' demands or needs and product forms by using a novel integral approach. High-price machine tools are used as our demonstration target. This integral approach adopts the “grey system theory (GST)”, and the state-of-the-art machine learning based modeling formalism “support vector regression (SVR)” in the “Kansei engineering (KE)” process. The GST is used to effectively determine the influence weighting of form parameters on product images and the SVR is used to precisely establish the mapping relationship between product form elements and product images. Furthermore, for practical concerns, a user-friendly design hybrid design expert system was developed based on the proposed novel integral schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Product aspect extraction supervised with online domain knowledge,"One of the most challenging problems in aspect-based opinion mining is aspect extraction, which aims to identify expressions that describe aspects of products (called aspect expressions) and categorize domain-specific synonymous expressions. Although a number of methods of aspect extraction have been proposed before, very few of them are designed to improve the interpretability of generated aspects. Existing methods either generate multiple fine-grained aspects without proper categorization or categorize semantically unrelated product aspects (e.g., by unsupervised topic modeling). In this paper, we first examine previous studies on product aspect extraction. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, two novel semi-supervised models for product aspect extraction are then proposed. More specifically, the proposed methodology first extracts seeding aspects and related terms from detailed product descriptions readily available on E-commerce websites. Next, product reviews are regrouped according to these seeding aspects so that more effective textual contexts for topic modeling are built. Finally, two novel semi-supervised topic models are developed to extract human-comprehensible product aspects. For the first proposed topic model, the Fine-grained Labeled LDA (FL-LDA), seeding aspects are applied to guide the model to discover words that are related to these seeding aspects. For the second model, the Unified Fine-grained Labeled LDA (UFL-LDA), we incorporate unlabeled documents to extend the FL-LDA model so that words related to the seeding aspects or other high-frequency words in customer reviews are extracted. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 ENevier B.V.

Multiple affective attribute classification of online customer product reviews: A heuristic deep learning method for supporting Kansei engineering,"Kansei engineering is a product design methodology that takes into account the affective needs of customers and translates them into product parameters. Traditionally, it uses questionnaire survey to collect and understand affective responses of customers. However, this process requires active involvement of participants, which is expensive, time-consuming, knowledge intensive and labour intensive. Therefore, it is only suitable for relatively small-scale operations. Today, due to the rapid development of e-commerce and social media, customers often write reviews to describe their feelings and comments after purchasing a product. A larger number of customer product reviews are available on the Internet, providing free, trustworthy, and growing data. Recently, many studies have used opinion mining and sentiment analysis to analyse customer product reviews. However, they focus primarily on product feature extraction or classification from a single perspective (i.e. good or bad). Research on multiple affective attributes has received less attention. In this paper, we propose a heuristic deep learning method that extracts affective opinions from customer product reviews, and classify them into seven pairs of affective attributes (i.e. like-dislike, aesthetic-inaesthetic, soft-hard, small-big, useful-useless, reliable-unreliable, and recommended-not recommended). An experiment has been conducted by using the product reviews available in Amazon.com . The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is above 86%, which outperforms the baseline methods. The extracted information has the potential to help both customers and product designers understand the customer comments from an affective perspective and assist them in making decisions.",2019,"Wang, W.

Mining of affective responses and affective intentions of products from unstructured text,"The current product design not only takes into account the function and reliability, but also concerns about the affective aspects in order to meet the consumers' emotional needs. However, there is always a gap between affective intentions of manufacturers and affective responses of consumers. Traditional methods rely on manual surveys to understand the gap, which is costly, time-consuming and in a small scale. In this paper, we propose a text mining method to extract affective intentions and affective responses from the online product description and consumer reviews. We build an affective profile for each product to visualise the gap between affective responses and affective intentions of the product. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study is conducted based on the public data from Amazon.com. We construct affective profiles for selected products and analyze affective gaps. We also evaluate the usefulness of the extracted affective information in product recommendations. The results showed that the gap between consumer's affective responses and manufacturer's affective intentions can be identified and visualised, which may help manufacturers to improve their products and services.

Supporting the construction of affective product taxonomies from online customer reviews: an affective-semantic approach,"Consumers today not only consider the functionality and reliability of products, but also concern with affective aspects of products to meet their emotional needs. Products with good affective design can excite consumers' psychological feelings and enhance consumer satisfaction. Affective engineering aims to discover relationships between product features and affective preferences for affective design. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual surveys, which are costly, and the affective design knowledge is difficult to share and update. There is a need to develop an efficient way to build a common knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose an affective-semantic approach to automatically construct affective product taxonomy based on online consumer reviews. We incorporate affective engineering and semantic analysis to extract product features and affective attributes from online product information. We construct taxonomy by relating the extracted product features and affective attributes based on their meaning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, experiments have been conducted using public available data. The results showed that the approach can effectively identify and measure affective information. It could help develop a common understanding of the design domain for reuse and expansion. It could also assist product designers review existing products based on affective aspects and consumer perspectives.",2019,"Wang, WM; Tian, ZG; Li, Z; Wang, JW; Barenji, AV; Cheng, MN",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,Semantic analysis; Kansei engineering; affective product taxonomy; opinion mining; affective design; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; DECISION-SUPPORT; KANO MODEL; DESIGN; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM; REPRESENTATION
Understanding engineering email: the development of a taxonomy for identifying and classifying engineering work,"It is widely believed that email is increasingly becoming the medium where in collaborative engineering work is done; yet, this assumption has not been properly examined. Thus, the extent of engineering information contained in emails and their potential importance within the context of knowledge management is unknown. To address this question, a study was undertaken with a large aerospace propulsion company to investigate the role and characteristics of email communication in engineering design projects. This paper describes the development of a taxonomy and classification method for achieving an understanding of email content and hence its use. The proposed approach is based on relevant techniques for analyzing communication and design text. The method codes the content of e-mail based on a hierarchical scheme by assigning email to categories and sub-categories that denote what topics the email is about, for which communicative purpose it has been sent, and whether it shows evidence of engineering work. The method is applied to a corpus related to the full life cycle of an engineering design project. Metrics for validation are discussed and applied to a sample case. Exemplar findings are presented to illustrate the type of investigations the method supports-including eliciting knowledge about project performance and identifying and accessing engineering knowledge. Finally, lessons from the development of the method, including a discussion of iteratively adaptive variants used to arrive at the final outcome, are discussed.",2010,"Wasiak, J; Hicks, B; Newnes, L; Dong, A; Burrow, L",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,Knowledge management; Information handling behavior; Content analysis; Email; Engineering work; E-MAIL; INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; ONTOLOGY; SUPPORT; SYSTEM
Generation of a function-component-parameter multi-domain matrix from structured textual function specifications,"This study introduces a method to build a multi-domain matrix (MDM), visualizing the intended architecture of a system within the component, function, and parameter domains. The MDM is generated from textual function specifications that are subject to a specific grammatical structure and vocabulary based upon the functional basis and interaction basis as presented in the literature. Two types of functions are distinguished: functions specifying what functionality a particular component provides to another component, and functions specifying the internal working (transformation of flow) of a particular component. The fixed grammar for the specification of the two types of functions allows for the automated derivation of dependencies between components, between functions of components, and between system parameters. A case study on a navigation lock demonstrates that the system architecture generated from function specifications matches the architecture of the real lock system fairly well. As such the method can be used in the early design phase to reveal the product architecture that is embodied in the function specifications of system components. The method may also support modeling of high-definition DSMs of existing engineering systems.",2018,"Wilschut, T; Etman, LFP; Rooda, JE; Vogel, JA",RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,System architecture; Linguistic function specification; Design structure matrix; DSM; Multi-domain matrix; MDM; Functional basis; Interaction basis; PRODUCT FAMILY DESIGN; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; BEHAVIOR
Realising the affective potential of patents: a new model of database interpretation for user-centred design,"This research sets out a new interpretation of the patent database using affective design parameters. While this resource contains a vast quantity of technical information, its extraction and use in practical design settings is extremely challenging. Until now, all filing and subsequent landscaping or profiling of patents has been based on their technical characteristics. We set out an alternative approach that utilises crowdsourcing to first summarise patents and then applies text analysis tools to assess the summarising text in relation to three affective parameters: appearance, ease of use, and semantics. The results been used to create novel patent clusters that provide an alternative perspective on relevant technical data, and support user-centric engineering design. The workflow and tasks to effectively interface with the crowd are outlined, and the process for harvesting and processing responses using a combination of manual and computational analysis is reviewed.

Criteria need to be determined to establish a typology as a knowledge-based system supporting education, literature, and industrial organizations. To this end, this study establishes criteria for design knowledge typology while considering design diversification by applying existing topological criteria to the classification of books, industries, and academic disciplines along with new views of design theorists. A matrix analysis was conducted to test the applicability of the design knowledge language data by checking them against extracted and defined criteria. We found it impossible to consistently typify contemporary design concepts with single-attribute criteria; the multiple-criteria classification method is much more effective. Further, contemporary design language has evolved from object-based to concept-based terms. Our study lays the groundwork for a useful typology for a design study schema.",2021,"Won, Hayoun; Park, YeongMog",DESIGN JOURNAL,industrial design; design knowledge; philosophy of design; knowledge organization; typology criteria
Ontology and rule-based natural language processing approach for interpreting textual regulations on underground utility infrastructure,"The nation's massive underground utility infrastructure must comply with a multitude of regulations. The regulatory compliance checking of underground utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automate the interpretation of utility regulations - the extraction of regulatory information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology (UPO) is domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology (SO) consists of two layers of semantics - linguistic spatial expressions and formal spatial relations - for better understanding the spatial language in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features (captured using common NLP techniques) and semantic features (captured using ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic (DL) clauses to achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2% precision and a 94.7% recall in information extraction, a 94.4% precision and a 90.1% recall in semantic formalization, and an 83% accuracy in logical formalization.",2021,"Xu, Xin; Cai, Hubo",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Ontology; Natural language processing; Information extraction; Information formalization; Pattern-matching rules; Utility regulations
Knowledge-driven intelligent quality problem-solving system in the automotive industry,"In the current automotive industry, quality management, especially quality problem-solving (QPS), plays an important role in fulfilling the expectations of demanding customers who seek high-quality products at low-cost. During the problem-solving process, various real-time and historical quality data are often not fully used, yet these data are of high value. This paper provides a comprehensive quality data mining process and method, as well as an intelligent quality problem-solving system (IQPSS). First, based on original quality problem data, an ontology library is constructed using the ontology generating module (OGM). Second, based on the generated ontology and the textual data of the original quality problem, this study builds a quality problem-solving knowledge base (QPSKB) by employing relevant algorithms in the knowledge transformation module (KTM). The component and fault relational matrix mining (CFRMM) algorithm is designed to extract the relationship matrix between the components and faults. The semi-supervised classification algorithm based on the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) is used to classify the immediate measures, causes and long-term measures into the corresponding ontology and express the ontology as their knowledge. Furthermore, the binary tree-based support vector machine (SVM) approach is applied to classify the cause texts into the factors of Man, Machine, Material, Method, and Environment (4M1E), which are the five factors in a fishbone diagram. In particular, the digital fishbone diagram is a brand-new type of fishbone diagram that subverts the traditional method of fish bone diagram analysis through brainstorming. A pilot run of the IQPSS has been undertaken in an automotive manufacturing company to demonstrate how quality management employees obtain this knowledge by searching in the IQPSS. The results show that the IQPSS contributes appreciably to the quality problem-solving in the manufacturing industry.",2018,"Xu, Zhaoguang; Dang, Yanzhong; Munro, Peter",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,Ontology; Knowledge management; Automotive industry; Digital fishbone diagram; Intelligent quality problem-solving; Quality management
Typical short-term remedy knowledge mining for product quality problem-solving based on bipartite graph clustering,"The increasing demand for high product quality by consumers poses new challenges to the efficiency and effectiveness of manufacturers' quality problem-solving. Solving problems based on personal experience makes problem-solving inefficient and ineffective. However, the data recorded during the problem solving process can offer valuable experiential knowledge for problem-solvers. In this study, we propose a bipartite graph clustering method for discovering the knowledge of short-term remedies, which is a type of solution, from past quality problem-solving data. In this method, several clustering algorithms are compared, and the K-means algorithm is selected to cluster quality problems into typical problem clusters. A novel two-stage clustering method based on verb and noun clustering is then developed to construct typical short-term remedy clusters. Based on the clustering result, the relationship between problem clusters and short-term remedy clusters is generated. A reasoning method for extracting shortterm remedy knowledge to solve new problems is introduced, and quality problem-solving data on an automobile manufacturer are used to carry out a case study. Tools such as Gephi and a prototype system are applied to provide “problem cluster-short-term remedy cluster” knowledge. Problem-solvers can use this knowledge to quickly address new problems, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of product quality problem-solving. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A Method for Function Dividing in Conceptual Design by Focusing on Linguistic Hierarchal Relations,In this study we attempted to develop a method that applies the notion and technology of natural language processing for operating a function dividing process in conceptual design. We formulated a function dividing process from a linguistic viewpoint and constructed linguistic hierarchal structures in this process. This method is significant in identifying hierarchal relationships between the upper- and lower-level functions from the viewpoint of linguistic hierarchal relations. An experiment was carried out to confirm whether the proposed methods were feasible and whether the extracted relations were meaningful for supporting the function dividing process.

An ontology-based approach for using physical effects in inventive design,"Su-Field analysis, as one of the inventive problem solving tools, can be used to analyze and improve the efficiency of a technical system. Generally, the process of using Su-Field models to solve a specific inventive problem includes building a Problem Model, mapping to a Generic Problem Model (the abstract Problem Model to describe the Problem Models with similar properties), finding a Generic Solution Model (the abstract Solution Model to represent the Solution Models with similar modifications) based on the corresponding inventive standard, and finally establishing and instantiating a Solution Model. As one of the most important phases of Su-Field analysis, the last step is normally implemented manually with the help of a knowledge base of physical effects, which link generic technical functions with specific applications and systems. The physical effects compatible with the context of the specific problem should be chosen to assist the users to instantiate the Solution Model. However, the physical effects and the specific problems are built at different levels of abstraction, and it is difficult for the users to choose. In order to facilitate the use of physical effects, this paper firstly proposes a new way of representing physical effects by making explicit a state change, that is, the couple of two states, before and after applying the physical effect Then, knowledge about using physical effects is formalized in OWL (Ontology Web Language), and constraint knowledge, such as the preconditions to use each kind of physical effects, is formalized in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language). Finally, the reasoning process of using physical effects is performed with the support of the Jess (lava Expert System Shell) rule engine. The case of a “Diving Fin” is used to illustrate the whole process in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge extraction and visualization of digital design process,"After digitally designing components of vehicles, a design team creates a virtual manufacturing environment that resembles actual manufacturing facilities. During this digital pre-assembly process, a review team examines each component, and records its problems and requirements in part verification reports. Once these reports are delivered to specific design team responsible for each part, the design team can make appropriate adjustments to their designs. This digital pre-assembly process can evaluate and prevent flaws in design prior to actual manufacturing, improving production quality and reducing manufacturing cost. As these reports are written in free text form, they, however, are not fully utilized for understanding problems arising from the design process. This paper proposes a method of applying text mining techniques on verification reports to extract insights for quality improvement. In this paper, following three text mining approaches are proposed: (1) Extracting n-grams for text preprocessing and constructing domain ontology; (2) Extracting meaningful insights from text preprocessing; (3) Creating intuitive visual tools to understand the extracted insights. The proposed method is applied on approximately 140,000 reports, and is validated through the quality of the answers obtained for the questions posed by the domain experts. The proposed method successfully extracts useful information from the text database, and provides intuitive graphical interface, thereby satisfying the need of the domain experts. This paper proposes a systematic framework of transforming huge amount of raw text data into intuitive visualization. Through this framework, meaningful knowledge can be extracted, analyzed and shared to improve the quality of the products. Main contribution of our paper is that it proposes a framework for knowledge extraction from pre-assembly process. Not only does it systematically arrange the data, but it also combines various data sources and creates a knowledge system to improve efficiency of the design process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An ontological basis for computer aided innovation,"Knowledge acquisition and capitalization to solve problems concerning artefact evolution, still called inventive design, has a certain quantity of specific characteristics. It needs the choice of certain pieces of knowledge that may induce evolutions; it leads to reformulating the initial problem to build an abstract model of the artefact. The theoretical approach we are interested in, called TRIZ (the Russian acronym for Theory for Inventive Problem Solving), when translated into a methodological procedure, has not been fully formalized yet. This article proposes an ontology of the main notions of the concepts associated to knowledge acquisition in this framework. This ontology, beyond the clarification it brings to the involved notions, will be the support of a software architecture for implementing the method for knowledge acquisition and problem formulation.

Multidocument Summarization of Engineering Papers Based on Macro- and Microstructure,"This paper focuses on automatic summarization of multiple engineering papers. A summarization approach based on documents' macro-and microstructure has been proposed. The macrostructure consists of a list of ranked topics from engineering papers. Topics are discovered by extracting and grouping frequently appearing word sequences into equivalence classes. Hence, the macrostructure symbolically presents the topical links in different papers. Meanwhile, the microstructure is defined as the rhetorical structure within a single paper. The identification of microstructure is approached as a classification problem. Each sentence in a paper is automatically labeled with one of the predefined rhetorical categories. Unlike existing summarization methods that first separate documents into nonoverlapping clusters and then summarize each cluster individually, our approach aims to summarize multiple documents according to the characteristics suggested at macro-and microstructure levels. The experimental study showed that our proposed approach outperformed peer systems in terms of recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation scores and readers' responsiveness. In an independent manual categorization task using the summaries generated by our approach and peer systems, we also performed better in terms of precision and recall.

Concept Clustering in Design Teams: A Comparison of Human and Machine Clustering,"Concept clustering is an important element of the product development process. The process of reviewing multiple concepts provides a means of communicating concepts developed by individual team members and by the team as a whole. Clustering, however, can also require arduous iterations and the resulting clusters may not always be useful to the team. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach on natural language descriptions of concepts that enables an automatic means of clustering. Using data from over 1000 concepts generated by student teams in a graduate new product development class, we provide a comparison between the concept clustering performed manually by the student teams and the work automated by a machine learning algorithm. The goal of our machine learning tool is to support design teams in identifying possible areas of over-clustering and/or under-clustering in order to enhance divergent concept generation processes.",2017,"Zhang, CW; Kwon, YP; Kramer, J; Kim, E; Agogino, AM",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,concept clustering; design process; machine learning; word embedding; 
Early detection of technology opportunity based on analogy design and phrase semantic representation,"In order to gain competitive advantage, technology opportunity detection in the latest and fast-growing areas has been becoming an important research issue. However, current research on technology opportunity detection is often focus on verifying the technology opportunities that have occurred, using the accumulated data from a specific field. Because of the time needed for data accumulation, these methods often have a substantial time lag and hard to early detect technology opportunities. It also leads to challenges to explore technology opportunities which still have not been covered in the current dataset. Moreover, phrase has more semantics than words but still rarely used and semantic represented in the process of technology opportunity detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on analogy design and phrase semantic representation for early detection of technology opportunity. Firstly, the source field corresponding to target field for analogy design is carefully selected, thus indirectly expanding the data coverage of the target field through the data from the source field. Secondly, effect phrases in both source field and target field are automatically extracted by BiLSTM-CRF and semantic represented by representation learning, then the analogy relationships are established through topic clustering on overall data. Finally, the scores of the topics are calculated based on ODI (outcome-driven innovation) and the topics with a high score are considered as early detected technology opportunities. The proposed method is validated using analogy between 3G and 4G. In this process, 3G is used as the source and 4G patents published in the early stage are used as the target for detecting technology opportunities in 4G, and the rest 4G patents published in the later stage are used for detecting the actual evolution results of technology opportunities. The comparison results prove that every detected technology opportunity in the early stage matches one or more topics of the actual evolution results in the later stage. In addition, this paper uses analogy between 4G (source field) and 5G (target field) for technology opportunities prediction, which may provide useful and helpful results for decision making in 5G and a good example for further application in other areas. These results have proved that the proposed method is effective and useful. Simultaneously, this method is a preliminary research and still need to be further studied on other datasets with different analogy types.",2020,"Zhang, Jinzhu; Yu, Wenqian",SCIENTOMETRICS,Analogy design; Early detection; Phrase semantic representation; Technology opportunity
A semantic representation model for design rationale of products,"Design rationale (DR) is crucial information in product design decision support, design analysis and design reuse. In this paper, based on the Issue-based Information System (IBIS) model, a new ontology-based semantic representation model for DR information; the integrated issue, solution, artifact and argument (ISAA) model; is proposed. The ISAA model introduces the ontology-based semantic representation mode to the DR representation and expands the concept elements of IBIS. The class of concept elements and the semantic relationships among them are defined by Web Ontology Language (OWL). The axioms and rules which are used to reason and analyze DR are defined and encoded with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which enrich the semantic relations defined by OWL The ISAA model represents the directed graph of IBIS to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph and serializes to an RDF/XML document which lays the foundation for retrieving and reasoning semantic information of DR. A semantic annotator integrating with the visual product design model was developed, by which the discrete information of thinking is captured and abstracted to a conceptual representation of the ISAA model. Finally, an example of DR representation for the spring operating mechanism of a high-voltage circuit breaker product is given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A Systematic Function Recommendation Process for Data-Driven Product and Service Design,"This paper presents a systematic function recommendation process (FRP) to recommend new functions to an existing product and service. Function plays a vital role in mapping user needs to design parameters (DPs) under constraints. It is imperative for manufacturers to continuously equip an existing product/service with exciting new functions. Traditionally, functions are mostly formulated by experienced designers and senior managers based on their subjective experience, knowledge, creativity, and even heuristics. Nevertheless, against the sweeping trend of information explosion, it is increasingly inefficient and unproductive for designers to manually formulate functions. In e-commerce, recommendation systems (RS) are ubiquitously used to recommend new products to users. In this study, the practically viable recommendation approaches are integrated with the theoretically sound design methodologies to serve a new paradigm of recommending new functions to an existing product/service. The aim is to address the problem of how to estimate an unknown rating that a target user would give to a candidate function that is not carried by the target product/service yet. A systematic function ! product recommendation process is prescribed, followed by a detailed case study. It is indicated that practically meaningful functional recommendations (FRs) can indeed by generated through the proposed FRP.",2017,"Zhang, ZN; Liu, L; Wei, W; Tao, F; Li, TM; Liu, A",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,; CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; BEHAVIOR; REPRESENTATION; ONTOLOGY; REVIEWS
A Machine Learning Approach to Customer Needs Analysis for Product Ecosystems,"Creating product ecosystems has been one of the strategic ways to enhance user experience and business advantages. Among many, customer needs analysis for product ecosystems is one of the most challenging tasks in creating a successful product ecosystem from both the perspectives of marketing research and product development. In this paper, we propose a machine -learning approach to customer needs analysis for product ecosystems by examining a large amount of online user-generated product reviews within a product ecosystem. First, we filtered out uninformative reviews from the informative reviews using a fastText technique. Then, we extract a variety of topics with regard to customer needs using a topic modeling technique named latent Dirichlet allocation. In addition, we applied a rule -based sentiment analysis method to predict not only the sentiment of the reviews but also their sentiment intensity values. Finally, we categorized customer needs related to different topics extracted using an analytic Kano model based on the dissatisfaction -satisfaction pairfrom the sentiment analysis.

Latent Customer Needs Elicitation by Use Case Analogical Reasoning From Sentiment Analysis of Online Product Reviews,"Different from explicit customer needs that can be identified directly by analyzing raw data from the customers, latent customer needs are often implied in the semantics of use cases underlying customer needs information. Due to difficulties in understanding semantic implications associated with use cases, typical text mining-based methods can hardly identify latent customer needs, as opposite to keywords mining for explicit customer needs. This paper proposes a two-layer model for latent customer needs elicitation through use case reasoning. The first layer emphasizes sentiment analysis, aiming to identify explicit customer needs based on the product attributes and ordinary use cases extracted from online product reviews. Fuzzy support vector machines (SVMs) are developed to build sentiment prediction models based on a list of affective lexicons. The second layer is geared toward use case analogical reasoning, to identify implicit characteristics of latent customer needs by reasoning the semantic similarities and differences analogically between the ordinary and extraordinary use cases. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is utilized to perform case retrieval and case adaptation.

Hybrid Association Mining and Refinement for Affective Mapping in Emotional Design,"Emotional design entails a bidirectional affective mapping process between affective needs in the customer domain and design elements in the designer domain. To leverage both affective and engineering concerns, this paper proposes a hybrid association mining and refinement (AMR) system to support affective mapping decisions. Rough set and K optimal rule discovery techniques are applied to identify hidden relations underlying forward affective mapping. A rule refinement measure is formulated in terms of affective quality. Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is derived to model backward affective mapping. Based on conjoint analysis, a weighted OLR model is developed as a benchmark of the initial OLR model for backward refinement. A case study of truck cab interior design is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the hybrid AMR system for decision support to forward and backward affective mapping.

Augmenting feature model through customer preference mining by hybrid sentiment analysis,"A feature model is an essential tool to identify variability and commonality within a product line of an enterprise, assisting stakeholders to configure product lines and to discover opportunities for reuse. However, the number of product variants needed to satisfy individual customer needs is still an open question, as feature models do not incorporate any direct customer preference information. In this paper, we propose to incorporate customer preference information into feature models using sentiment analysis of user-generated online product reviews. The proposed sentiment analysis method is a hybrid combination of affective lexicons and a rough-set technique. It is able to predict sentence sentiments for individual product features with acceptable accuracy, and thus augment a feature model by integrating positive and negative opinions of the customers. Such opinionated customer preference information is regarded as one attribute of the features, which helps to decide the number of variants needed within a product line. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed method via an application case of Kindle Fire HD tablets.

Both eye catching and highly memorable and at the same time self-explanatory mindmapping examples are presented. These were designed to include basic and advanced level digital mindmapping features tailored to significantly speed up and maintain a high work quality level of patent search professionals. A special emphasis is put on the great benefit of organising and accessing the plethora of internet-based worldwide online patent registers through mindmapping, both in terms of managing the constantly changing deep links to the actual search options for e.g., legal status information, and keeping track of the offered level of content.
